               LAUNCHER, aims at a lower roof across the street and FIRES a

               the car- two other men wearing CLOWN MASKS.

                         Three of a kind.  Let's do this.

               One of the Clowns looks up from loading his automatic weapon.

                         is an extra share.  Five shares is 
                         plenty.

                         Six shares.  Don't forget the guy 
                         who planned the job.

               of the GOTHAM FIRST NATIONAL BANK.

               The Security Guard looks up- Grumpy FIRES into the ceiling.

               Customers SCREAM.  Chuckles CRACKS the Security Guard.

                         It didn't dial out to 911- it was 
                         trying to reach a private number.

               Behind him, Happy RAISES his silenced HANDGUN.

                                     HAPPY
                         Is it a problem?

                                     DOPEY
                         No, no.  I'm done here.

               Happy SHOOTS.  Dopey SLUMPS.  Happy picks up his bag and 
               FORCES OPEN the roof access door...

           8   INT. STAIRWELL, BANK -- DAY                                    8   

               ...and speeds down the stairs, to the basement.  He SLAMS 
               open the door...

           9   INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY                                   9   

               ...and comes face to face with a huge VAULT.

          10   INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY                                       10   

               Bozo and Grumpy move down the line of hostages- Bozo hands 
               each Hostage OBJECTS from a bag.  A GRENADE.  Grumpy follows,

               PULLING THE PINS.

                                     GRUMPY
                         Obviously, we don't want you doing 
                         anything with your hands other than 
                         holding on for dear life.

               BLAM.  Chuckles is BLOWN OFF HIS FEET- Grumpy and Bozo DIVE 
               for cover- the Bank Manager steps out of his office, SHOTGUN 
               in hand.  Hostages SCRAMBLE, CLINGING their grenades...

          11   INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY                                  11   

               Happy CLAMPS a DRILL to the vault- the bit SPINS- SLIDES 
               into the metal door- a BOLT of ELECTRICITY RIPS THROUGH THE 
               DRILL,

               THROWING HAPPY TO THE FLOOR--

          12   INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY                                       12   

               Grumpy and Bozo cower as the Bank Manager FIRES again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         4.


                                     GRUMPY
                         He's got three left?

               Bozo raises TWO fingers.  Grumpy squeezes off a SHOT.  The 
               Bank Manager FIRES.  FIRES again.  Grumpy looks at Bozo, who 
               nods.  Grumpy JUMPS UP.

               The Bank Manager FIRES- Grumpy GRUNTS as buckshot CLIPS his 
               shoulder.  FALLS.  The Bank Manager moves in for the kill, 
               FUMBLING for new shells.  Bozo STANDS- SHOOTS him.

               Bozo picks up the shotgun.  Grumpy checks his wound- it's 
               superficial.  He struggles to his feet.

                                     GRUMPY (CONT'D)
                         Where'd you learn to count?!

               Bozo's mask stares him down.  Grumpy heads for the stairs in 
               the back.  Bozo starts loading fresh shells into the shotgun.

                                     BANK MANAGER
                         You have any idea who you're stealing 
                         from?  You and your friends are dead.

               Bozo looks down at him.  Says nothing.

          13   INT. VAULT ROOM, BANK -- DAY                                  13   

               Happy at the vault door, barefoot, turning the tumblers with 
               hands stuffed into his SNEAKERS.  Grumpy walks in.

                                     HAPPY
                         They wired this thing up with 5,000 
                         volts.  What kind of bank does that?

                                     GRUMPY
                         A mob bank.  Guess the Joker's as 
                         crazy as they say.

               Happy shrugs.  Grips the WHEEL BOLT and SPINS it.

                                     GRUMPY (CONT'D)
                         Where's the alarm guy?

                                     HAPPY
                         Boss told me when the guy was done I 
                         should take him out.  One less share.

                                     GRUMPY
                         Funny, he told me something similar...

               Happy FREEZES.  The wheel SPINS to a STOP- the vault DOOR 
               CLUNKS OPEN- Happy GRABS for his weapon- SPINS to see Grumpy 
               SHOOT.  Grumpy steps over Happy into the vault...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         5.


          14   INT. VAULT, BANK -- DAY                                       14   

               ...which is filled with an eight-foot MOUNTAIN OF CASH.

          15   INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY                                       15   

               Grumpy walks into the lobby, straining under several DUFFELS 
               filled with cash.  He DUMPS them.  Looks at Bozo.  LAUGHS.

                                     GRUMPY
                         C'mon, there's a lot to carry...

          16   INT. LOBBY, BANK -- DAY                                       16   

               Bozo walks back into the lobby with two more DUFFELS.  Sets 
               them down on an ENORMOUS PILE.  Grumpy looks at it.

                                     GRUMPY
                         If this guy was so smart he would 
                         have had us bring a bigger car.

               Grumpy JABS his pistol in Bozo's back.  Takes his weapon.

                                     GRUMPY (CONT'D)
                         I'm betting the Joker told you to 
                         kill me soon as we loaded the cash.

                                     BOZO
                              (shakes head)
                         No.  I kill the bus driver.

                                     GRUMPY
                         Bus driver?  What bus-

               Bozo steps backwards.  SMASH.  Hostages SCREAM as the TAIL 
               END OF A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS ROCKETS through the front of the 
               bank, SLAMMING Grumpy into the teller's window.

               Bozo picks up Grumpy's weapon.  Another clown OPENS the rear 
               door of the bus.  Bozo SHOOTS him.  Then loads the bags onto 
               the bus.  The wounded Bank Manager watches him.  In the 
               distance: SIRENS.

                                     BANK MANAGER
                         Think you're smart, huh?  Well, the 
                         guy who hired you's just do the same 
                         to you...

               Bozo slowly shakes his head.

                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
                         Sure he will.  Criminals in this 
                         town used to believe in things...

               Bozo turns back to the Bank Manager.  Crouches over him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         6.


                                     BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
                         Honor.  Respect.  What do you believe, 
                         huh?  What do you bel-

               Bozo slides a GRENADE into the man's mouth.  A PURPLE THREAD 
               is knotted around the pin.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I believe that what doesn't kill 
                         you...

               Bozo PULLS off his MASK.  The Bank Manager GASPS.  In the 
               reflections of the glass DEBRIS behind the Bank Manager we 
               see GLIMPSES of a SCARRED MOUTH and CLOWN MAKEUP.  THE JOKER.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         ...simply makes you stranger.

               The Bank Manager's eyes go wide.  The Joker rises, strolls 
               towards the bus, the purple thread attached to the grenade 
               pin UNRAVELING FROM THE PURPLE LINING of his jacket as he 
               walks.  The Joker climbs into the bus, SHUTS the rear door,

               TRAPPING THE PURPLE THREAD...

          17   EXT. SCHOOL, GOTHAM -- DAY                                    17   

               Kids pour out, heading onto a long line of school buses.

          18   INT. BANK -- CONTINUOUS                                       18   

               As the bus pulls out, the purple thread PULLS THE PIN-- 
               hostages scream and scurry away from the Bank Manager, who 
               shakes with fear as, with a FIZZ, the grenade does not 
               explode, but SPEWS RED SMOKE.

          19   EXT. BANK -- DAY                                              19   

               The School Bus pulls free of the Bank wall and pulls out 
               onto the street, SLIDING INTO THE LINE OF IDENTICAL BUSES 
               HEADING PAST THE BANK.  The buses trundle past COP CARS racing 
               up the street... and we-

                                                                    CUT TO:

          20   EXT. MOVING OVER GOTHAM -- NIGHT                              20   

               From the top of a brick building a SHAFT OF LIGHT comes on.

          21   EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- CONTINUOUS                          21   

               A PATROLMAN looks up at the BAT-SIGNAL.  Smiles.  A DEALER 
               standing beside a car spots the signal.  Steps back.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         7.


                                     DEALER
                         No, man.  I don't like it tonight.

                                     BUYER
                         What're you, superstitious?  You got 
                         more chance of winning the powerball 
                         than running into him...

          22   INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT               22   

               DETECTIVE RAMIREZ, female, rookie detective, 30's, makes 
               coffee, watching a news show on the television.

               ON SCREEN: The host, MIKE ENGEL, lays into the MAYOR.

                                     ENGEL
                         Mr Mayor, you were elected on a 
                         campaign to clean up the city... 
                         when are you going to start?  

                                     MAYOR
                         Well, Mike-

                                     ENGEL
                         Like this so-called Batman- a lot of 
                         people say he's doing some good that 
                         criminals are running scared...  but 
                         I say NO.  What kind of hero needs 
                         to wear a mask?  You don't let 
                         vigilantes run around breaking the 
                         law... where does it end?   Yet, we 
                         hear rumors that instead of trying 
                         to arrest him the cops are using him 
                         to do their dirty work.

                                     MAYOR
                         I'm told our men in the Major Crimes 
                         Unit are close to an arrest.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Hey, Wuertz- the Mayor says you're 
                         closing in on the Batman.

               WUERTZ looks up, listless.  Crumples up a paper.

                                     WUERTZ
                         The investigation is ongoing.

               He throws the paper at the trash.  It rebounds off a board 
               headed 'BATMAN: SUSPECTS.' Lined with pictures: Abraham 
               Lincoln.  Elvis.  The Abominable Snowman.

          23   EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT -- NIGHT                      23   

               Ramirez comes out onto the roof.  LIEUTENANT GORDON sits by 
               a SEARCHLIGHT.  She hands Gordon a cup of coffee.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Ever intending to see your wife again, 
                         Lieutenant?

                                     GORDON
                         I thought you had to go look after 
                         your mother, detective.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         They checked her back into hospital.

                                     GORDON
                         I'm sorry.

                                     RAMIREZ
                              (making light)
                         Least there she's got someone round 
                         the clock.  Unlike your wife.
                              (looks at bat-signal)
                         He hasn't shown?

               Gordon gets up.  Looks into the sky at the bat-signal.

                                     GORDON
                         Often doesn't.  But I like reminding 
                         everybody that he's out there.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Why wouldn't he come?

                                     GORDON
                         Hopefully... Because he's busy.

          24   EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT                                  24   

               Two black SUV's pull onto the top floor.  A large man emerges--
               the CHECHEN.  A BODYGUARD points at the sky.  The Chechen 
               peers up at the BAT-SIGNAL.  Shrugs.

                                     CHECHEN
                         That's why we bring dogs.

               BODYGUARD 2 opens the back door- three enormous ROTWEILERS 
               emerge, GROWLING.  The Chechen crouches, KISSING the dogs.

                                     CHECHEN (CONT'D)
                         My little princes...
                                     (MORE)

                                                                         9.


                                     CHECHEN (CONT'D)
                              (to bodyguards)
                         The Batman's invisible to you fools... 
                         but my little princes...  they can 
                         find human meat in complete darkness.

               The Chechen moves to the second SUV, reaches in and DRAGS 
               out a skinny, wild-eyed JUNKIE by his hair.

                                     JUNKIE
                              (babbling)
                         No!  No get 'em off me!  Off me!

               The Chechen drags the Junkie towards a battered white van.

               The van's REAR DOORS OPEN... two armed THUGS emerge, carrying 
               BARRELS... a third hovers in the dark interior.

                                     CHECHEN
                         Look!  Look what your drugs did to 
                         my customers!

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Buyer beware...

               The figure emerges: SCARECROW.  Wearing his mask.

                                     SCARECROW
                         I told your man my compound would 
                         take you places.  I never said they'd 
                         be places you wanted to go.

                                     CHECHEN
                         My business is repeat customers.

                                     SCARECROW
                         If you don't like what I have to 
                         offer, buy from someone else.  
                         Assuming Batman left anyone else to 
                         buy from.

               The Chechen frowns.  THE DOGS START BARKING.

                                     BODYGUARD
                              (nervous)
                         He's here.

               A BURLY THUG at the periphery is suddenly SUCKED into the 
               darkness.  In his place a shadow straightens, revealing 
               POINTED BAT-EARS against the glittering skyline.

                                     CHECHEN
                         Come on, sonofbitch- my dogs are 
                         hungry, pity there's only one of 
                         you...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        10.


               A BODYGUARD to the side DISAPPEARS with a scream, and a SECOND 
               BAT-SHADOW appears.

               The Chechen looks taken aback.  Three more BAT-SHADOWS 
               appear... even the dogs stop growling.

               BOOM!  A hole appears in the SUV next to the Chechen.  The 
               first bat-shadow steps into the light carrying a SHOTGUN.

               CHAOS as men scatter and the rooftop erupts in GUNFIRE.  The 
               Chechen TURNS as he hears one of his men SCREAM.

                                     CHECHEN (CONT'D)
                         Loose the dogs!

               A Bodyguard releases the DOGS- they RACE, SALIVATING, into 
               the darkness...

               The Dogs RACE towards a Bat-Shadow- the first dog LEAPS, 
               gets its JAWS around the Bat-Shadow's throat...

               Scarecrow ducks behind the van- holes PUNCHED in the side by 
               shotgun blasts right behind him.  He starts to climb into 
               the driver's seat-

               The muzzle of a shotgun is pressed to the back of his head- 
               a bat-shadow is behind him- he SPRAYS him with FEAR TOXIN- 
               the bat-shadow collapses to the ground, SCREAMING.  The 
               Chechen, cowering from gunfire, looks down at him.

                                     SCARECROW
                         Not the real thing.

                                     CHECHEN
                         How you know?

                                     SCARECROW
                         We're old friends.

               A HUGE BLACK SHAPE SLAMS down onto a row of parked cars.  
               The BATMOBILE.

                                     SCARECROW (CONT'D)
                         That's more like it.

               The Chechen's men BLAST away at the front of the car: the 
               bullets SPARK off its monstrous surface harmlessly...

          25   INT. BATMOBILE -- CONTINUOUS                                  25   

               The cockpit is EMPTY.  One of the screens reads "LOITER".

               The shooting STOPS.  The screen switches to "INTIMIDATE"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        11.


          26   EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS                             26   

               The men STARE at the Batmobile for a quiet moment... BOOM!  
               The Batmobile CANNONS blast cars all around the men- 

               A bat-shadow lines up his shotgun on a running bodyguard-  
               CLUNK- a BLACK GAUNTLET grasps the barrel and BENDS it upwards 
               with a HOWL of tortured steel- the bat-shadow looks into the 
               face of the Batman.  The REAL BATMAN.

               The Bat-shadow STUMBLES BACKWARDS in terror, leaving the 
               bent shotgun in Batman's hand.  Batman OPENS his hand, 
               revealing a PNEUMATIC MANGLE hidden in his palm-

               Batman bears down on the dogs mauling another bat-shadow- 
               DRAWS his GRAPPLING GUN and SHOOTS his grapple into the fake 
               Batman's leg and RIPS him from the dogs, one dog HANGING ON 
               as Batman pulls the unconscious man away... the Chechen RUNS 
               down the ramp towards the exit...

               As Batman KICKS the dog off the fake Batman- the Chechen 
               gets into his SUV- another dog LOCKS ITS JAWS around Batman's 
               forearm, RIPPING, TEARING- Batman SWINGS THE DOG OVER HIS 
               HEAD- SMASHES it against the ground- its jaws OPEN...

               Batman rises, an engine RACES behind him- he can't turn in 
               time- BLAM- he's SLAMMED sideways by the speeding van.

          27   INT. VAN -- CONTINUOUS                                        27   

               Scarecrow, driving, NODS at him and hits the gas... Batman 
               raises his hand, revealing his jointed mangle and pistons.

               The mangle STRAIGHTENS and ROTATES from his palm to the knife 
               edge of his opened hand...

               Batman CHOPS straight through the windshield- pulls his hand 
               out and CHOPS again- the mangle gets STUCK- Scarecrow steers 
               towards a column...

          28   EXT. PARKING GARAGE -- CONTINUOUS                             28   

               Batman can't free himself- he turns a dial on his forearm 
               piston- EXPLOSIVE BOLTS blow, freeing his gauntlet from the 
               mangle- he ROLLS free of the van as it SCRAPES the column 
               and barrels down the circular exit ramp.

               Batman rises.  A phony batman lying on the ground watches as 
               Batman climbs up to the edge of the ten-story corkscrew ramp 
               and stands there, waiting for something.

               After a moment he JUMPS... and falls... ten stories...

               He's about to hit the exit ramp- the van appears- his cape 
               POPS OPEN- he SLAMS into the roof, CRUSHING the cab.

                                                                        12.


          29   EXT. ROOFTOP, PARKING GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER                 29   

               The Chechen's men are lined up against the wall, bound with 
               zip-ties.  So are the fake batmen.  Batman DUMPS Scarecrow 
               next to the three "Batmen", RIPS his mask off.

                                     "BATMAN"
                         We're trying to help you!

                                     BATMAN
                         I don't need help.

                                     SCARECROW
                         Not my diagnosis.

               Batman silences Scarecrow with his boot.  Turns to "Batman"

                                     BATMAN
                         Don't let me find you out here again.

               Batman moves towards the Batmobile.

                                     "BATMAN"
                         You need us!  There's only one of 
                         you-it's war out here!

               Batman gets into the Batmobile.

                                     "BATMAN" (CONT'D)
                         What gives you the right?!  What's 
                         the difference between you and me?!

               As the Canopy hisses shut-

                                     BATMAN
                         I'm not wearing hockey pads.

               The "Batman" looks down at his makeshift costume as the 
               Batmobile ROARS past.

          30   EXT. BANK -- NIGHT                                            30   

               LIEUTENANT GORDON ducks the barrage of SHOUTED QUESTIONS 
               from press and picks his way into the lobby of the bank.

          31   INT. LOBBY, BANK -- NIGHT                                     31   

               FORENSIC SPECIALISTS work the room.  Ramirez hands Gordon 
               PRINTS- indicates the surveillance cameras.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         He can't resist showing us his face.

               Gordon looks at the grainy blow-up of THE JOKER'S FACE: 
               sweating clown makeup plastered thick around the mouth.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        13.


                                     GORDON
                         Put this out, by morning we can put 
                         a big top over central holding and 
                         sell tickets.  What's he hiding under 
                         that makeup?

               Gordon approaches a FORENSIC PHOTOGRAPHER shooting Grumpy's 
               body.  Gordon crouches to look at his clown mask.  Batman 
               steps from the shadows.  Gordon nods at Ramirez.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Give us a minute, please, people!

               The Forensic team and Ramirez leave.  Gordon hands Batman 
               the blow-up of the Joker.

                                     BATMAN
                         Him again.  Who are the others?

                                     GORDON
                         Another bunch of small timers.

               Batman pulls a DEVICE from his belt- moves to the bundles of 
               cash scattered near the clown's body.  The device PINGS.

               Batman picks up a BUNDLE.  Hands it to Gordon.

                                     BATMAN
                         Some of the marked bills I gave you.

                                     GORDON
                         My detectives have been making drug 
                         buys with them for weeks.  This bank 
                         was another drop for the mob.  That 
                         makes five banks- we've found the 
                         bulk of their dirty cash.

                                     BATMAN
                         Time to move in.

               Gordon waves the photo.

                                     GORDON
                         What about this Joker guy?

                                     BATMAN
                         One man or the entire mob?  He can 
                         wait.

                                     GORDON
                         We'll have to hit all banks 
                         simultaneously.  SWAT teams, backup.

               Gordon holds up the bundle of banknotes.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         When the new D.A. gets wind of this, 
                         he'll want in.

                                     BATMAN
                         Do you trust him?

                                     GORDON
                         Be hard to keep him out.

               Gordon bags the cash.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         I hear he's as stubborn as you.

               But Batman is already gone.

          32   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- MORNING                               32   

               Alfred walks past soaring downtown views as he carries a 
               breakfast tray through the vast, empty penthouse.  He stops, 
               looking at a still-made bed.  Alfred sighs, turns.

          33   EXT. RAIL YARDS -- MORNING                                    33   

               Alfred gets out of the Rolls carrying a thermos.  He walks 
               towards a RAILWAY BRIDGE, stops at a FREIGHT CONTAINER 
               sitting, lopsided, on blocks.  Alfred unlocks the RUSTY 
               PADLOCK AND CHAIN.  Steps inside.

          34   INT. FREIGHT CONTAINER -- CONTINUOUS                          34   

               Alfred FUMBLES in the dark- bangs his elbow- A HISS as the 
               FLOOR LOWERS... Alfred sinks down into...

          35   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS                                 35   

               The container floor lowers on a giant PISTON.  Alfred steps 
               off into a large, LOW-CEILINGED CONCRETE CHAMBER.  The 
               Batmobile sits in the middle.  Machines- 3D printers, power 
               tools- dot the high-tech space.  At one end, Wayne sits at a 
               bank of monitors watching CCTV footage of the bank robbery.

                                     ALFRED
                         Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt 
                         and you can swap not sleeping in a 
                         penthouse for not sleeping in a 
                         mansion.

               Alfred places a cup of coffee in front of Wayne, who is 
               STITCHING up a cut on his arm.

                         When you stitch yourself up you make 
                         a bloody mess.

                         A dog.

                         A big dog.  There were more copycats

                         Perhaps you could hire some of them 
                         and take weekends off.

                                     WAYNE
                         This wasn't exactly what I had in 
                         mind when I said I wanted to inspire 
                         people.

                         I know.  But things are improving.  
                         Look at the new District Attorney...

               Wayne indicates a monitor: a handsome MAN in a suit.

                                     WAYNE
                         I am.  Closely.  I need to know if 
                         he can be trusted.

               Alfred looks at other images- the D.A. at a meeting.  
               Campaigning.  Helping someone out of a cab: RACHEL.

                                     ALFRED

                         If you ever took one, I might.

               Alfred bites the thread.  Examines his stitches.  Looks at 
               the SCARS criss-crossing Wayne's shoulders.

                                     ALFRED

          36   INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY                         36   

               HARVEY DENT bursts into the courtroom.  Assistant D.A. RACHEL 
               DAWES, look up, ANNOYED.

                                     DENT
                         Sorry I'm late, folks.

               Rachel leans in to Dent, speaking under her breath.

                                     RACHEL
                         Where were you?

                         I know the briefs backwards.

               Dent pulls a large silver dollar out of his pocket.  Grins.

                                     DENT
                         Well, then, fair's fair: heads, I'll 
                         take it.  Tails, he's all yours.

               Dent FLIPS.  Shows it to Rachel- heads.

                         I make my own luck.

               Dent looks across at the defendant- SAL MARONI.

                                     MARONI
                         I thought the DA just played golf

                         time to put you away for life, Sally.

               The BAILIFFS lead a THIN MAN into the witness box.  ROSSI.

          37   INT. COURTROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY                         37   

               Rossi takes a SIP of water.  Dent works the room.

                                     DENT
                         With Carmine Falcone in Arkham, 
                         someone must've stepped up to run 
                         the so-called family.
                              (Rossi nods)

                              (Rossi nods again)
                         Could you identify him for us, please?

               Dent turns to Maroni, who is poker-faced.  Dent smiles.

                         You win, counselor.  It was me.

               Dent's smile disappears.  He turns back to Rossi.

                                     DENT
                         I've got a sworn statement from you 
                         that this man, Salvatore Maroni, is 
                         the new head of the Falcone crime 
                         family.

                                     ROSSI
                         Maroni?  He's a fall guy.  I'm the 
                         brains of the organization.

               LAUGHS from the gallery.  Dent turns to the JUDGE.

                                     DENT
                         Permission to treat the witness as 
                         hostile?

                                     ROSSI
                         Hostile?  I'll show you hostile.

               Rossi JUMPS UP, points a GUN at Dent's face.  SCREAMS from 
               the gallery.  Rossi PULLS the TRIGGER- the gun MISFIRES with 
               a POP.  Dent steps forward, grabs the GUN- DECKS Rossi with 
               a RIGHT CROSS- unloads the GUN and sets it down in front of 
               Maroni.

                                     DENT

                         American.

               Everyone STARES, open-mouthed, as Dent adjusts his tie.  The 
               Bailiffs are wrestling Rossi from the box-

               Rachel, excited, leads Dent through the lobby.

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll never link the gun to Maroni, 
                         so we can't charge him, but I'll 
                         tell you one thing- the fact they 
                         tried to kill you means we're getting

               Rachel turns to Dent.  Smooths his lapels.

               Gordon stands as Dent enters.  The two men shake.

                         Word is you've got a hell of a right

                         they keep giving you second chances.

               Dent picks up a bundle of bills from the heist.

               Dent tosses the bills back onto his desk.  Annoyed.

                                     DENT
                         I've put every known money launderer 
                         in Gotham behind bars.  But the mob 
                         is still getting its money out.  I 
                         think you and your "friend" have 
                         found the last game in town and you're 
                         trying to hit 'em where it hurts: 
                         their wallets.  Bold.  You gonna 
                         count me in?

                                     GORDON
                         In this town, the fewer people know 
                         something, the safer the operation.

                                     DENT
                         Gordon, I don't like that you've got 
                         your own special unit, and I don't 
                         like that it's full of cops I 
                         investigated at internal affairs.

                                     GORDON
                         If I didn't work with cops you'd 
                         investigated while you were making 
                         your name at I.A.- I'd be working 
                         alone.  I don't get political points 
                         for being an idealist- I have to do 
                         the best I can with what I have.

               Dent looks at Gordon.  Considering how to proceed.

                                     DENT
                         You want me to back warrants for 
                         search and seizure on five banks 
                         without telling me who we're after?

                                     GORDON
                         I can give you the names of the banks.

                                     DENT
                         Well, that's a start.  I'll get you 
                         your warrants.  But I want your trust.

                                     GORDON
                              (rises)
                         You don't have to sell me, Dent.  We 
                         all know you're Gotham's white knight.

                                     DENT
                              (grins)
                         I hear they've got a different 
                         nickname for me down at M.C.U..

               Gordon smiles.

          40   INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY                      40   

               LUCIUS FOX, CEO of Wayne Enterprises, and the board listen 
               to LAU, 40s, CEO of L.S.I. Holdings.

                                     LAU
                         In China L.S.I. Holdings stands for 
                         dynamic new growth.  A joint Chinese 
                         venture with Wayne Enterprises will 
                         be a powerhouse.

                                     FOX
                         Well, Mr. Lau, I speak for the rest 
                         of the board, and Mr. Wayne, in 
                         expressing our own excitement...

               The Chinese look to the head of the table: Wayne, ASLEEP.

          41   INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- DAY                        41   

               Fox shows Lau to the elevator.  He's joined by, REESE, 30s, 
               an ambitious M and A consultant lawyer.

                                     LAU
                         It's OK, Mr. Fox.  Everyone knows 
                         who really runs Wayne Enterprises.

                                     FOX
                         We'll be in touch as soon as our 
                         people have wrapped up the diligence.

               The elevator doors close.  Reese frowns.

                                     REESE
                         Sir, I know Mr. Wayne's curious how 
                         his trust fund gets replenished but 
                         frankly... it's embarrassing.

               Fox heads for his office, Reese in tow.

                                     FOX
                         You worry about the diligence, Mr. 
                         Reese.  I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

                                     REESE
                         It's done- the numbers are solid.

                              (smiles)
                         Do it again.  Wouldn't want the trust 
                         fund to run out, would we?

          42   INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- CONTINUOUS               42   

               Wayne is standing by the window.

                                     FOX
                         Another long night?
                              (Wayne smiles)
                         This joint venture was your idea, 
                         and the consultants love it, but I'm 
                         not convinced.  L.S.I.'s grown 8 
                         percent annually, like clockwork.  
                         They must have a revenue stream that's 
                         off the books.  Maybe even illegal.

                                     WAYNE
                         OK.  Cancel the deal.

                                     FOX
                              (looks at Wayne)
                         You already knew.

                                     WAYNE
                         I needed a closer look at their books.

               Fox looks at Wayne.  Wry.

                                     FOX
                         Anything else you can trouble me 
                         for?

                                     WAYNE
                         I need a new suit.

                                     FOX
                              (looks him over)
                         Three buttons is a little nineties.

                                     WAYNE
                         I'm not talking about fashion, Mr.Fox, 
                         so much as function.

               Wayne pulls some diagrams.  Fox looks them over.

                                     FOX
                         You want to be able to turn your 
                         head?

                                     WAYNE
                         Sure make backing out of the driveway 
                         easier.

                         I'll see what I can do.

          43   INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT                                      43   

               Rachel and Dent at a table.  Dent looks a little intimidated 
               by the surroundings.

                                     DENT
                         It took three weeks to get a 
                         reservation and I had to tell them I 
                         worked for the government.

                                     RACHEL
                         Really?

                                     DENT
                         This city health inspector's not 
                         afraid to pull strings.

               Rachel smiles.  Then, over Dent's shoulder, she sees Wayne 
               enter, accompanied by a beautiful woman.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         What?

                                     WAYNE
                         Rachel!  Fancy that.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, Bruce.  Fancy that.

                                     WAYNE
                         Rachel, Natascha.  Natascha, Rachel.

                                     NATASCHA
                              (Russian accent)
                         Hello.

                                     DENT
                         The famous Bruce Wayne.  Rachel's 
                         told me everything about you.

                                     WAYNE
                         I certainly hope not.

                                     RACHEL
                         Bruce, this is Harvey Dent.

                                     WAYNE
                         Let's put a couple tables together.

                                     DENT
                         I don't know if they'll let us-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        24.


                                     WAYNE
                         They should!  I own the place.

                                     RACHEL
                         For how long?  About three weeks?

                                     WAYNE
                         How'd you know?

                                     RACHEL
                         Natascha, aren't you...?

                                     WAYNE
                         Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

                                     RACHEL
                         Harvey's taking me next week.

                                     WAYNE
                         You're into ballet, Harvey?

                                     RACHEL
                         No.  He knows I am.

               An extra table arrives.

          44   INT. SAME -- LATER                                            44   

               They finish up dinner.

                                     NATASCHA
                         No, come on- how could you want to 
                         raise children in a city like this?

                                     WAYNE
                         I was raised here.  I turned out OK.

                                     DENT
                         Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

               Rachel gives Dent a withering look.

                                     WAYNE
                         The Palisades?  Sure.  You know, as 
                         our new D.A. you might want to figure 
                         out where your jurisdiction ends.

                                     NATASCHA
                         I'm talking about the kind of city 
                         that idolizes a masked vigilante...

                                     DENT
                         Gotham's proud of an ordinary man 
                         standing up for what's right.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        25.


                                     NATASCHA
                         Gotham needs heroes like you- elected 
                         officials, not a man who thinks he's 
                         above the law.

                                     WAYNE
                         Exactly.  Who appointed the Batman?

                                     DENT
                         We did.  All of us who stood by and 
                         let scum take control of our city.

               Wayne watches Dent.  Sees his passion.

                                     NATASCHA
                         But this is a democracy, Harvey.

                                     DENT
                         When their enemies were at the gate, 
                         the Romans would suspend democracy 
                         and appoint one man to protect the 
                         city.  It wasn't considered an honor.  
                         It was considered public service.

                                     RACHEL
                         And the last man they asked to protect 
                         the republic was named Caesar.  He 
                         never gave up that power.

                         Well, I guess you either die a hero 
                         or you live long enough to see 
                         yourself become the villain.  Look, 
                         whoever the Batman is, he doesn't 
                         want to spend the rest of his life 
                         doing this.  How could he?  Batman's 
                         looking for someone to take up his 
                         mantle.

                                     NATASCHA
                         Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

                                     DENT
                         Maybe.  If I'm up to it.

               Natascha reaches up and covers the top half of Dent's face.

                                     NATASCHA
                         But what if Harvey Dent is the caped 
                         crusader?

                                     DENT
                         If I were sneaking out every night 
                         someone would've noticed by now.

               Dent takes Rachel's hand.  Rachel glances at Wayne.  Awkward.

                                     WAYNE
                         Well, you've sold me, Dent.  I'm 
                         gonna throw you a fundraiser.

                                     DENT
                         That's nice of you, Bruce, but I'm 
                         not up for reelection for three years.  
                         That stuff won't start for-

                                     WAYNE
                         I don't think you understand.  One 
                         fundraiser with my pals, you'll never 
                         need another cent.

          45   EXT. BACK ALLEY, HOTEL, DOWNTOWN -- DAY                       45   

               A line of high-end AUTOS dispenses well dressed GANGSTERS.

          46   INT. KITCHEN, HOTEL -- DAY                                    46   

               The Chechen walks through a METAL DETECTOR manned by two 
               CHINESE.  A lean, African-American man, 50's, is being wanded.  
               This is GAMBOL.  He nods at the Chechen, wary.

          47   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS                     47   

               Gotham's most notorious GANGSTERS.  A door opens, and two 
               BURLY CHINESE enter, carrying a TV.  They set it down on the 
               end of the table.

               The screen flickers to life: Lau.  The room ERUPTS.

                                     LAU (ON T.V.)
                         Gentlemen, please.  As you're all 
                         aware, one of our deposits was stolen.  
                         A relatively small amount: 68 million.

                                     CHECHEN
                         Who's stupid enough steal from us?

                         I'm told the man who arranged the 
                         heist calls himself Joker.

                         suit and make-up.  He's not the 
                         problem- he's a nobody.
                              (looks at Lau)
                         The problem is our money being tracked 
                         by the cops.

               Murmurs of surprise.

                                     LAU
                         Thanks to Mr. Maroni's well-placed 
                         sources we know that police have 
                         indeed identified our banks using 
                         marked bills and are planning to 
                         seize your funds today-

               Everyone starts SHOUTING at once.

          48   EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN BANKS -- CONTINUOUS                     48   

               Gordon sits in a SWAT van outside a bank.  Stephens is outside 
               another.  Ramirez a third...

               SWAT teams CHECK WEAPONS and prepare move...

          49   INT. SOCIAL CLUB, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS                      49   

               Lau waits for the noise to subside.

                                     CHECHEN
                         You promised safe, clean money launder-

                         With the investigation ongoing, none 
                         of you can risk hanging on to your 
                         own proceeds.  And since the 
                         enthusiastic new D.A. has put all my 
                         competitors out of business, I'm 
                         your only option.

                         So what are you proposing?

                                     LAU
                         Moving all deposits to one secure 
                         location.  Not a bank.

                                     GAMBOL
                         Where, then?

                         If the police were to gain leverage 
                         over one of you everyone's money 
                         would be at stake.

                                     CHECHEN
                         What stops them getting to you?

                                     LAU
                         As the money is moved I go to Hong 
                         Kong.  Far from Dent's jurisdiction. 
                         And the Chinese will not extradite 
                         one of their own.

               From the back of the room comes LAUGHTER.  It grows and grows, 
               until it fills the room.  All eyes turn:

               The Joker.  Sweaty clown makeup obscuring the AWFUL SCARS 
               which widen his mouth into a PERMANENT, GHOULISH SMILE.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I thought I told bad jokes.

                                     GAMBOL
                         Give me one reason I shouldn't have 
                         my boy here pull your head off.

               The Joker pulls out a freshly sharpened pencil.

                                     THE JOKER
                         How about a magic trick?

               The Joker SLAMS the pencil into the table, leaving it UPRIGHT.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         I'll make this pencil disappear.

               Gambol nods.  His BODYGUARD MOVES at the Joker- who SIDESTEPS-
               GRIPS his head- SLAMS it, FACE DOWN, onto the table...

               The Bodyguard goes LIMP and slides off of the table.  The 
               PENCIL is gone.  MAGIC.  The Joker BOWS.  Grins at Gambol.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         And by the way, the suit wasn't cheap.  
                         You should know.  You bought it.

               Gambol STANDS, furious.  The Chechen stops him.

                                     CHECHEN
                         Sit.  I wanna hear proposition.

               The Joker nods his thanks.  Rises.

                                     THE JOKER
                         A year ago these cops and lawyers 
                         wouldn't dare cross any of you.  
                         What happened?  Did your balls drop 
                         off?  See, a guy like me-

                                     GAMBOL
                         A freak.

               Laughs.  Which the Joker tries to ignore.

                                     THE JOKER
                         A guy like me... I know why you're 
                         holding your little group therapy 
                         session in broad daylight.  I know 
                         why you're afraid to go out at night.  
                         Batman.  He's shown Gotham your true 
                         colors.  And Dent's just the 
                         beginning.
                              (indicates Lau)
                         And as for his so-called plan- Batman 
                         has no jurisdiction.  He'll find him 
                         and make him squeal.
                              (smiles at Lau)
                         I can tell the squealers every time.

                                     CHECHEN
                         What you propose?

                                     THE JOKER
                         It's simple.  Kill the Batman.

               Jeers.  Laughter.

                                     MARONI
                         If it's so easy why haven't you done 
                         it already?

                                     THE JOKER
                         Like my mother used to tell me- if 
                         you're good at something, never do 
                         it for free.

                                     CHECHEN
                         How much you want?

                                     THE JOKER
                         Half.

               Laughter.  The Joker shrugs.  Rises.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         You don't deal with this now, soon 
                         Gambol won't even be able to get a 
                         nickel for his grandma-

                         Enough from the clown.

               Gambol gets up, MOVING at the Joker, who casually opens his 
               coat, revealing EXPLOSIVES wired to his chest.  Gambol stops.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Let's not blow this out of all 
                         proportion.

               Gambol stares at the Joker.  Hard.

                                     GAMBOL
                         You think you can steal from us and 
                         just walk away?  I'm putting the 
                         word out- 5 hundred grand for this 
                         clown dead.  A million alive, so I 
                         get to teach him some manners, first.

               The Joker shrugs.  Turns to the assembled.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Let me know when you change your 
                         minds.

               The Joker strolls out.  Maroni turns to Lau.

                                     MARONI
                         How soon can you move the money?

               A CHINESE MAN finishes loading a TRACTOR TRAILER with cash

                         Rest assured, your money is safe.

               He is already on his private jet.

               IN THE SKY: THE BAT SIGNAL.

          54   EXT. ROOF, POLICE STATION -- NIGHT                            54   

               Batman emerges from the shadows.  The man next to the glowing 
               spotlight turns: DENT.

                                     DENT
                         You're a hard man to reach.

               Gordon BURSTS onto the rooftop, weapon drawn.  Sees Dent.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Lau's halfway to Hong Kong- if you'd 
                         asked, I could have taken his passport- 
                         I told you to keep me in the loop.

                                     GORDON
                         Yeah?  All that was left in the vaults 
                         were the marked bills- they knew we 
                         were coming!  As soon as your office 
                         got involved, there's a leak-

                                     DENT
                         My office?!  You're sitting down 
                         here with scum like Wuertz and 
                         Ramirez...
                              (off look)
                         Oh, yeah, Gordon- I almost had your 
                         rookie cold on a racketeering beef.

                                     GORDON
                         Don't try to cloud the fact that 
                         clearly Maroni's got people in your 
                         office, Dent.

               Dent turns to Batman.

                                     DENT
                         We need Lau back, but the Chinese 
                         won't extradite a national under any 
                         circumstances.

                                     BATMAN
                         If I get him to you, can you get him 
                         to talk?

                                     DENT
                         I'll get him to sing.

                                     GORDON
                         We're going after the mob's life 
                         savings.  Things will get ugly.

                                     DENT
                         I knew the risks when I took this 
                         job, lieutenant.  Same as you.
                              (turns to Batman)
                         How will you get him back, anyway?

               Batman is gone.  Dent looks around, startled.  Gordon smirks.

                                     GORDON
                         He does that.

          55   INT. FOX'S OFFICE, WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY                    55   

               Fox gets up from behind his desk.

                                     FOX
                         Our Chinese friend left town before 
                         I could tell him the deal is off.

                                     WAYNE
                         I'm sure you've always wanted to go 
                         to Hong Kong.

               Fox opens the door to a private elevator.

          56   INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS                           56   

               Fox turns a key.

                                     FOX
                         What's wrong with a phone call?

                                     WAYNE
                         I think Mr. Lau deserves a more 
                         personal touch.

          57   INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- CONTINUOUS                  57   

               Fox leads Wayne off the elevator and into the vast space.

                                     FOX
                         For high altitude jumps, you need 
                         oxygen and stabilizers.  I must say- 
                         compared to your usual requests, 
                         jumping out of an airplane is pretty 
                         straightforward.

               Lucius stops at a cabinet, pulls open a drawer and hauls out 
               an oxygen tank and ribbed rubber hosing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     WAYNE
                         How about getting back into the plane?

                                     FOX
                         I can recommend a good travel agent.

                                     WAYNE
                         Without it landing.

                                     FOX
                         That's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

               He shuts the drawer.  Moves off, thinking.

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         I don't think I have anything here.
                         The CIA had a program in the '60s 
                         for getting their people out of hot 
                         spots.  Called Sky Hook.  Now-

               Fox opens a cabinet to reveal COMPONENTS OF A NEW BAT-SUIT.  
               ARMORED PLATING secured to mesh.  Wayne lifts an arm.

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         Hardened kevlar plates on a titanium-
                         dipped fiber tri-weave for 
                         flexibility...

               Wayne examines DOUBLE BLADE SCALLOPS on the gauntlet...

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         You'll be lighter, faster, more 
                         agile...

               Wayne flinches as the BLADES FIRE, SPINNING LIKE THROWING 
               STARS, NARROWLY MISSING his ear, embedding themselves in a 
               filing cabinet.  Fox looks at him.

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         Perhaps you should read the 
                         instructions, first.

                                     WAYNE
                         Sorry.

               Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.

                                     FOX
                         Now, there's a trade-off... the spread 
                         of the plates gives you weak spots.  
                         You'll be more vulnerable to gunfire 
                         and knives.

                         We wouldn't want things getting too 
                         easy, would we?
                              (picks up suit)
                         How will it hold up against dogs?

               Fox looks at him quizzically.

                                     FOX
                         You talking chihuahuas or rotweilers?
                              (Wayne smiles)
                         It should do fine against cats.

          58   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY                                        58   

               Wayne examines a parachute harness.  Alfred unfolds a diagram 
               of a NAVY CARGO PLANE with a giant "V" mounted on the front.

                                     ALFRED
                         I found one.  In Arizona.  Very nice 
                         man says it will take him a week to 
                         get it running.  And he takes cash.  
                         What about a flight crew?

                                     WAYNE
                         South Korean smugglers.  They run 
                         flights into Pyongyang, below radar 
                         the whole way.  Did you think of an 
                         alibi?

               Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.

                                     ALFRED
                         Oh, yes.

          59   EXT. BALLET -- NIGHT                                          59   

               Rachel and Dent arrive to find the box office SHUTTERED.  A 
               sign:'PERFORMANCE CANCELED.' A newspaper story is taped to 
               the glass.  Over a picture of BRUCE WAYNE ON A YACHT:

               LOVE BOAT- Billionaire absconds with entire Moscow ballet.

          60   EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S YACHT, THE CARIBBEAN -- DAY                60   

               Alfred, picks his way over twelve SUNBATHING BALLERINAS.

               Wayne looks up from a newspaper.  Alfred points to a SEAPLANE 
               gently touching down across the bay.

                                     ALFRED
                         I believe your plane is here.

                                     WAYNE
                         You look tired, Alfred.  Will you be 
                         all right without me?

               A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.

                                     ALFRED
                         If you can tell me the Russian for 
                         'apply your own bloody suntan lotion.'

               Wayne tosses a large, waterproof kit bag into the water and 
               JUMPS in after it.  Begins swimming over to the sea-plane.

          61   INT. POOL HALL -- NIGHT                                       61   

               Gambol racks up.  A bodyguard steps into the room.

                                     BODYGUARD
                         Somebody here for you.

               Gambol looks to the back- three rough customers are waiting.

                                     BODYGUARD (CONT'D)
                         They say they've killed the Joker.

               They've come for the reward.

                                     GAMBOL
                         They bring proof?

                                     BODYGUARD
                         They say they've brought the body.

               The bodyguards FLOP a BODY wrapped in garbage bags onto the 
               table.  The BOUNTY HUNTERS wait in the corner.  Gambol pulls 
               back one of the garbage bags, revealing the Joker's bloodied 
               face.  Gambol spits.  Turns to face the bounty hunters.

                                     GAMBOL
                         So.  Dead you get five hundred-

               Behind Gambol, the Joker SITS UP- THRUSTS knives into the 
               bodyguards' chests.  Gambol spins to see a crazy grin on the 
               Joker's spit-dribbled face-

                                     THE JOKER
                         How about alive?

               The Joker gets a switchblade in Gambol's mouth- SHARP METAL 
               PULLING THE CHEEK TAUT.  The Bounty Hunters subdue the 
               remaining bodyguards.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Wanna know how I got these scars?

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         My father was a drinker and a fiend.  
                         He'd beat mommy right in front of 
                         me.  One night he goes off crazier 
                         than usual, mommy gets the kitchen 
                         knife to defend herself.  He doesn't 
                         like that.  Not.  One.  Bit.

               The Joker TUGS Gambols cheek with the blade.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         So, me watching, he takes the knife 
                         to her, laughing while he does it.  
                         Turns to me and says 'why so serious?'  
                         Comes at me with the knife- 'why so 
                         serious?'  Sticks the blade in my 
                         mouth- 'Let's put a smile on that 
                         face' and...

               The Joker looks up at the ASHEN FACES of the remaining Body 
               Guards.  Smiles.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Why so serious?

               The Joker FLICKS his wrist- the Body Guards flinch as Gambol 
               goes down.  The Joker turns to them.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Now, our organization is small, but 
                         we've got a lot of potential for 
                         aggressive expansion... so which of 
                         you fine gentlemen would like to 
                         join our team?

               The three bodyguards all nod.  The Joker SNAPS a pool cue.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Only one slot open right now- so 
                         we're going to have try-outs.

               The Joker drops the broken cue in the middle of the men.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Make it fast.

               The men stare at each other.  Then at the jagged pool cue.

          62   EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL, HONG KONG -- DAY                        62   

               A HELICOPTER touches down on one of the hotel's twin helipads.  
               Two L.S.I. VPs approach, heads ducked.  Fox gets out- they 
               shake hands, shouting over the engine-

                                     VP
                         Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox!  Mr. 
                         Lau regrets he is unable to meet you 
                         in person.  But with his current 
                         legal difficulties...!

                                     FOX
                         I understand!

          63   INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY                             63   

               The VPs usher Fox towards security.

                                     VP
                         I'm afraid for security reasons I 
                         have to ask for your mobile phone.

               Lucius hands his phone to a SECURITY GUARD, who puts the 
               phone in a box underneath his station.

          64   INT. L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY                                    64   

               Fox and Lau eat lunch in a dining room overlooking the city.

                                     LAU
                         I must apologize for leaving Gotham 
                         in the middle of our negotiations.  
                         This misunderstanding with the Gotham 
                         police force... I couldn't let such 
                         a thing threaten my company.  A 
                         businessman of your stature will 
                         understand.  But with you here... we 
                         can continue.

                                     FOX
                         Well, it was good of you to bring me 
                         out here in such style, Mr. Lau.  
                         But I've actually come...

               A CELL PHONE rings.  Fox pulls out a second, identical, phone.  
               Fox presses the off switch and places the phone by his plate.

                                     LAU
                         We do not allow cell phones in-

                                     FOX
                         Sorry.  Forgot I had it.  So, I've 
                         come to explain why we're going to 
                         have to put our deal on hold...

               Lau stares at Fox.  Clearly furious.  Fox smiles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        38.


                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         We can't afford to be seen to do 
                         business with... well, whatever it 
                         is you're accused of being.  A 
                         businessman of your stature will 
                         understand.

               Lau gets up.  Silent.  Fox retrieves his phone.  Stands.

                                     LAU
                              (cold)
                         I think, Mr. Fox, that a simple phone 
                         call might have sufficed.

                                     FOX
                         Well, I do love Chinese food.  And 
                         Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think 
                         we'd been deliberately wasting your 
                         time.

                                     LAU
                         Just accidentally wasting it.

                                     FOX
                              (laughs)
                         That's very good- "accidentally."  
                         Very good.  I'll be sure and tell 
                         Mr. Wayne that he was wrong about 
                         you not having a sense of humor.

          65   INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- DAY                             65   

               Lucius walks back through security.  Nods at the VP, who 
               bows, offering Lucius his cell phone.  Lucius shakes his 
               head, holds up the IDENTICAL PHONE.  The VP smiles, nods, 
               puts the phone back into the tray with several others.

          66   INT. HOLD, C-130 CARGO HAULER -- DAWN                         66   

               Two SMUGGLERS steal glances at Wayne, crouched at the rear 
               in balaclava and flight suit.  The COPILOT signals Wayne, 
               who pulls on his oxygen mask and stands up.  The rear of the 
               plane OPENS.  Wayne steps to the edge, then JUMPS.

          67   EXT. SKIES ABOVE HONG KONG -- DAWN                            67   

               Moving across the water towards Hong Kong harbor...tiny figure 
               DROPS into frame, PLUMMETING towards the water-

               SPEEDING past the highest floors of skyscrapers, seconds 
               from impact.  Wayne PULLS the chute- DROPS into the water...

          68   EXT. BENEATH FREEWAY, HONG KONG HARBOR -- DAY                 68   

               Wayne pulls himself out of the water, dragging up his pack.

          69   EXT. CENTRAL ESCALATORS -- DAY                                69   

               Wayne stops halfway up the crowded commuter escalator.  He 
               takes a camera and lines up a shot like any tourist.

                                     FOX (O.S.)
                         There's a better view from the peak 
                         tram.

               Wayne turns to find Fox standing there, street map out.

                                     WAYNE
                         How's the view from L.S.I. Holdings?

                                     FOX
                         Restricted.  Lau's holed up in there 
                         good and tight.  Here...

               Fox shows Wayne the phone.  The display: a 3-D map of Lau's 
               office suite.  Wayne takes the phone, impressed.

                                     WAYNE
                         What's this?

                                     FOX
                         I had R and D work it up- it sends 
                         out high frequencies and records the 
                         response time to map an environment.

                                     WAYNE
                              (smiles)
                         Sonar.  Just like a b-

                         Submarine.  Like a submarine.

                                     WAYNE
                         And the other device?

                                     FOX
                         In place.

               Wayne nods, moves away.

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         Mr. Wayne?
                              (Wayne turns)
                         Good luck.

               Moving towards the tallest building in the glittering skyline 
               to find Wayne, crouched on the roof.  The blades of his 
               gauntlets CLICK into place.  He dons the helmet-like cowl.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               His "cape" is in the form of a hard faceted PACK.

               He stands- pulls two black boxes from his belt, CLICKS them 
               together and UNFOLDS them into a RIFLE-LIKE DEVICE.  Batman 
               SCOPES a second, lower building.  Adjust a setting and FIRES-- 
               four times...

               Four small STICKY BOMBS SLAP onto the glass of the lower 
               building.  They have visible timers which are COUNTING DOWN.

          71   INT. LOBBY, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                           71   

               Lucius' cell phone GLOWS in the box under the Security Guard's 
               desk.  CHARACTERS race across the screen.

               Then the monitor FLICKERS off, the lights DIM and all of the 
               security doors in the front of the building OPEN at once.

               The Guard grabs his radio- CALLS FOR HELP...

          72   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING L.S.I.HOLDINGS                       72   

               Batman LAUNCHES into the glittering night, DROPPING from the 
               tall tower... his pack BURSTS OPEN, becoming his BAT WINGS-
               he GLIDES down to the lower building, STREAKING around it, 
               BANKING HARD to line up with a window in the rear...

          73   INT. LAU'S OFFICE, L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                   73   

               Lau is talking on the phone, staring at a profit projection 
               on a flat screen monitor.  Suddenly the room goes dark.

          74   EXT. L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- CONTINUOUS                            74   

               As Batman HURTLES towards the glass he COLLAPSES his wings, 
               WRAPPING his cape around himself and CANNONBALLING THROUGH

               THE GLASS--

          75   INT. LAU'S OFFICE SUITE, L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT             75   

               ROLLING across the floor in a flurry of broken glass...

          76   INT. LAU'S OFFICE, TOP FLOOR, L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT        76   

               Lau pulls out a HANDGUN.

          77   INT. HALLWAY, L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                        77   

               Lau steps into the hallway.  His BODYGUARDS are waiting for 
               him, carrying FLASHLIGHTS.

                                     LAU
                         Where the hell are the cops?

                                     BODYGUARD
                         Coming.

                         What the hell am I paying them for?

               They head for the stairwell.

          78   EXT. L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                                 78   

               A small ARMY of Hong Kong police lead by a HONG KONG DETECTIVE 
               descends on the building.

          79   INT. MEZZANINE LEVEL, L.S.I. HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                79   

               Lau and his men make their way out onto the mezzanine.

               Across the room, something makes a CRASHING SOUND.  Lau's 
               men fan out, trying to cover the room with their flashlights.

               Suddenly, one of the flashlights goes DARK.  Then another.

               Someone SCREAMS.

               Lau FIRES.  Then FIRES again.  The muzzle flash from his 
               weapon STROBES the room.

          80   EXT. L.S.I. HOLDINGS, HONG KONG -- NIGHT                      80   

               Cops SWARM into the building.  A LOBBY SECURITY GUARD directs 
               the Hong Kong Detective where to go...

          81   INT. OFFICE, L.S.I.HOLDINGS -- NIGHT                          81   

               Lau LOCKS the door.  RELOADS.  The door is KICKED open.  Lau 
               FIRES.  No one is there.

               Lau stares, finger restless on the trigger.  From his right-- 
               a NOISE.  He turns and FIRES.

               In the muzzle FLASH: Batman, bearing down on him like a demon.

               Lau FIRES, and FIRES again as Batman TACKLES him.  Batman 
               pulls out a SMALL PACK- STRAPS it onto Lau-

               The COUNTER on the sticky bombs hits 0-

               The Hong Kong Detective and the Cops BURST into the room- 
               the WALL AND CEILING BEHIND BATMAN AND LAU EXPLODES- revealing 
               the dawn sky above Hong Kong.

               The Detective looks around as he hears a LOW RUMBLE...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        42.


               Batman JERKS the RIPCORD on Lau's pack.  Cops cower as a 
               WEATHER BALLOON EXPLODES out of the pack, unreeling high-
               test nylon.  The Cops cock their weapons.

               Lau looks up.  Bemused.  The weather balloon is two hundred 
               feet up, swaying gently.  The RUMBLE BUILDS...

               Suddenly, a MASSIVE C-130 ROARS over.  The large V on the 
               front of the plane SNAGS the line- Lau and BATMAN are YANKED 
               THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE CEILING--

               Lau SCREAMS as he and Batman SOAR UP INTO THE DAWN SKY...

               The Detective looks up.  Batman and Lau are gone.

          82   INT. GORDON'S OFFICE, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY              82   

               Gordon is looking through case files.  Ramirez walks in.

               Gordon follows Ramirez through a CROWD of excited cops.  On 
               the ground, trussed like a chicken- Lau.  A sign taped to 
               his chest: 'Please deliver to Lieutenant Gordon.'

          84   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY           84   

               Lau sits next to his sleazy lawyer, EVANS.  Rachel walks in.

                                     RACHEL
                         Give us the money and we'll deal.

                                     LAU
                         The money is the only reason I'm 
                         still alive.

               Rachel leans forward, speaking softly.  Clearly.

                                     RACHEL
                         You mean when they hear that you've 
                         helped us they're going to kill you?

                                     EVANS
                         Are you threatening my client?

                                     RACHEL
                         No, I'm just assuming your client's 
                         cooperation with this investigation.
                         As will everyone.
                              (moves to the door)
                         Enjoy your stay in County, Mr.Lau.

                                     LAU
                         Wait.
                              (Rachel stops)
                         I won't give you the money, but I'll 
                         give you my clients.  All of them.

                                     RACHEL
                         You were a glorified accountant- 
                         what could you have on all of them 
                         that we could charge?

                                     LAU
                         I'm good with calculation- I handled 
                         all their investments.  One big pot.

          85   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY             85   

               Dent hits a buzzer.  Turns to Gordon.

                                     DENT
                         I've got it.  RICO.  If their money 
                         was pooled we can charge all of them 
                         as one criminal conspiracy.

                                     GORDON
                         Charge them with what?

               Rachel enters.

                                     DENT
                         In a RICO case if we can charge any 
                         of the conspirators with a felony-

                                     RACHEL
                         We can charge all of them with it.

               Dent nods at Rachel, excited.

          86   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY           86   

               Rachel comes back in.

                                     RACHEL
                         Mr. Lau, do you have details of this 
                         communal fund?  Ledgers, notebooks...?

                                     LAU
                              (smiles)

                         plane back to Hong Kong.

                                     RACHEL
                         Once you've testified in open court.  
                         So with your clients locked up, what 
                         happens to all that money?

                         Like I said- I'm good with 
                         calculation.

          87   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS      87   

               Dent and Gordon watch Lau.

                                     GORDON
                         He can't go to County.  I'll keep 
                         him here in the holding cells.

                                     DENT
                         What is this Gordon, your fortress?

                                     GORDON
                         You trust them over at County?

                                     DENT
                         I don't trust them here.

                                     GORDON
                         Lau stays.

                                     DENT
                         It's your call, Lieutenant.  Be right.

                                     GORDON
                         I am, counselor.

               Dent stands in front of a small crowd of reporters.

                                     REPORTER
                         The Chinese government claim their 
                         international rights have been broken.

                                     DENT
                         I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel 
                         arrangements...

          89   INT. RESTAURANT -- CONTINUOUS                                 89   

               Dent's press conference plays on a TV in the corner.

                                     DENT
                              (grins)
                         ...but I'm sure glad he's back.

               Maroni and the Chechen are watching the TV.

                                     CHECHEN
                         I put word out.  We hire the clown.

                                     CHECHEN (CONT'D)
                              (off look)
                         He was right.  We have to fix real 
                         problem.  Batman.

               Maroni shakes his head.  Spots Gordon walking over dangling 
               a pair of handcuffs.  Nods at the TV.

                                     GORDON
                         Our boy looks good on the tube.

                                     MARONI
                         You sure you want to embarrass me in 
                         front of my friends, Lieutenant?

                                     GORDON
                         Don't worry, they're coming, too.

               Gordon points out the window to a PRISON BUS.

          90   EXT. VARIOUS DOWNTOWN AND OUTLYING LOCATIONS -- DAY           90   

               Prison buses in every neighborhood.  COPS load them with 
               CRIMINALS.  Stephens puts Crime Boss in a prison bus.

          91   INT. COURTROOM A, GOTHAM MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE -- DAY          91   

               JUDGE SURRILLO reads the list of charges.

                                     JUDGE SURRILLO
                         ...849 counts racketeering, 246 counts 
                         fraud, 87 counts conspiracy murder...

               Judge Surrillo turns the page.  A PLAYING CARD sits there.  
               A Joker.  He glances at it, curious, puts it to one side.

                                     JUDGE SURRILLO (CONT'D)
                         ...how do the defendants plead?

               An ARMY of DEFENSE LAWYERS jostle YELLING ALL AT ONCE.  The 
               STENOGRAPHER looks up, helpless.

          92   INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- DAY                                    92   

               The MAYOR, COMMISSIONER LOEB, and Gordon look up as Dent 
               enters.

                                     MAYOR
                         DENT!  What was that circus?!

                                     DENT
                         I asked Gordon to make some arrests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        46.


                                     LOEB
                              (looks at report)
                         Five hundred and-

                                     GORDON
                         Forty-nine, sir.

               Gordon nods at Dent, approving.  Dent grins back.

                                     MAYOR
                         549 criminals at once?!  How did you 
                         convince Surrillo to hear this farce?

                                     DENT
                         She shares my enthusiasm for justice.  
                         After all, she is a judge.

                                     MAYOR
                         Even if you blow enough smoke to get 
                         convictions out of Surrillo, you'll 
                         set a new record at appeals for 
                         quickest kick in the ass.

                                     DENT
                         It won't matter.  The head guys make 
                         bail, sure... but the mid-level guys, 
                         they can't, and they can't afford to 
                         be off the streets long enough for 
                         trial and appeal.  They'll cut deals 
                         that include some jail time.  Think 
                         of all you could do with 18 months 
                         of clean streets.

               The Mayor waves Gordon and Loeb out.

                                     MAYOR
                         The public likes you, Dent.  That's 
                         the only reason this might fly.  But 
                         that means it's on you.  They're all 
                         coming after you, now.  Not just the 
                         mob... politicians, journalists, 
                         cops-anyone whose wallet's about to 
                         get lighter.  Are you up to it?
                              (Dent smiles)
                         You better be.  They get anything on 
                         you... those criminals will be back 
                         on the streets...

               The Mayor turns to look out of the window.  Quiet.

                                     MAYOR (CONT'D)
                         Followed swiftly by you and me-

               BANG!  A DARK SHAPE CRACKS THE GLASS in front of the Mayor's 
               nose.  Dent rushes to the window, looks out...

          93   EXT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS                                  93   

               PEDESTRIANS look up, someone SCREAMS, someone POINTS- five 
               stories up... SWINGING from a FLAGPOLE...

               BATMAN.  HANGING BY HIS NECK.  DEAD.  His mouth roughly 
               painted in a DEMONIC CLOWN SMILE.

          94   EXT. CITY HALL -- MOMENTS LATER                               94   

               "Batman" is lowered from the flagpole.  The same fake Batman 
               we saw earlier.  Pinned to his chest by a KNIFE, a PLAYING 
               CARD.  A Joker.  Gordon moves closer to the body.  The card 
               has writing on it: WILL THE REAL BATMAN PLEASE STAND UP?

          95   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY                                   95   

               Wayne comes into the living room, excited.  Alfred is 
               supervising party arrangements.

                                     WAYNE
                         How's it going?

                                     ALFRED
                         I think your fundraiser will be a 
                         great success, sir.

                                     WAYNE
                         And why do you think I wanted to 
                         hold a party for Harvey Dent?

                                     ALFRED
                         I assumed it was your usual reason 
                         for socialising beyond myself and 
                         the scum of Gotham's underbelly: to 
                         try and impress Miss Dawes.

                                     WAYNE
                         Very droll.  But very wrong.  Actually 
                         it's Dent.  You see-

                                     MAYOR
                         Wayne trails off as he spots something 
                         on the television: the Batman HANGING 
                         as from a NEWS CAMERA, framed by a 
                         graphic that reads 'BATMAN DEAD?'  . 
                         Image cuts to Engel in the studio.

                                     ENGEL
                         ...Police released video footage 
                         found concealed on the body.  
                         Sensitive viewers be aware: it is 
                         disturbing.

               The image cuts to a BLINDFOLDED MAN, wearing a makeshift 
               Batman costume- face bruised and bloody.  In some kind of 
               bright, fluorescent-lit room.

                         Brian Douglas.

                         Are you the real Batman?

                         No.

                                     VOICE
                         Why do you dress up like him?

                                     MAN
                         He's a symbol... that we don't have 
                         to be afraid of scum like you...

                                     VOICE
                         But you do, Brian.  You really do.  
                         You think the Batman's helped Gotham?

               Brian nods uncertainly...

                                     VOICE (CONT'D)
                         Look at me.
                              (Brian looks down)
                         LOOK AT ME!

               Brian looks up- the camera swings into the face of the Joker, 
               in CHALK-WHITE makeup, RED SMEAR of lipstick on his SCARS.

                                     THE JOKER
                         This is how crazy Batman's made 
                         Gotham.  You want order in Gotham?  
                         Batman has to go.  So...
                              (leans in)
                         Batman must take off his mask, and 
                         turn himself in.  Every day he 
                         doesn't... people will die.  Starting 
                         tonight.  I'm a man of my word.

               The tape cuts to STATIC.

               Wayne turns to Alfred.  Silent.

          96   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING                               96   

               Dent and Rachel get off the lift.  Dent stands in awe of the 
               penthouse and its guests.

                                     RACHEL
                         Now I've seen it all: Harvey Dent, 
                         scourge of the underworld, scared 
                         stiff by the trust fund brigade.

               Rachel spots someone and darts off-

                                     DENT
                         Rachel-

                                     ALFRED
                         A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

               Dent turns to see Alfred with drinks on a silver tray.

                                     DENT
                         Thanks.  Alfred, right?

                                     ALFRED
                         Yes, sir.

                                     DENT
                         Rachel talks about you all the time.  
                         You've known her her whole life?

                                     ALFRED
                         Not yet, sir.

                                     DENT
                              (smiles, surveys crowd)
                         Any psychotic ex-boyfriends I should 
                         be aware of?

                                     ALFRED
                         Oh, you have no idea.

               Alfred leaves Dent standing there, puzzled.  The crowd REACTS 
               as a LOUD ROAR drowns conversation... Dent looks out-

          97   EXT. HELIPAD, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                   97   

               Wayne's CHOPPER touches down.  He spills out with a clutch 
               of

               SUPERMODELS...

          98   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                            98   

               Wayne and the supermodels come out of the helipad elevator-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        50.


                                     WAYNE
                         Sorry, I'm late- glad you started 
                         without me!  Where's Rachel?!

               Rachel cringes slightly.  Wayne spots her.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         Rachel Dawes- my oldest friend.  
                         When she told me she was dating Harvey 
                         Dent, I had one thing to say... the 
                         guy from those god-awful campaign 
                         commercials?

               Laughter.  Dent shifts, embarrassed.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         II Believe in Harvey Dent.' Nice 
                         slogan, Harvey.  Certainly caught 
                         Rachel's attention.  But then I 
                         started paying attention to Harvey, 
                         and all he's been doing as our new 
                         D.A., and you know what?  I believe 
                         in Harvey Dent.  On his watch, Gotham 
                         can feel a little safer.  A little 
                         more optimistic.  So get out your 
                         checkbooks and let's make sure that 
                         he stays right where all of Gotham 
                         wants him...
                              (raises his glass)
                         All except Gotham's criminals, of 
                         course.  To the face of Gotham's 
                         bright future- Harvey Dent.

               Dent smiles accepting the toast.

          99   INT. CORRIDOR, MCU -- EVENING                                 99   

               Ramirez catches up to Gordon, holding paperwork.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         That Joker card pinned to the body?  
                         Forensics found three sets of D.N.A..

                                     GORDON
                         Any matches?

                                     RAMIREZ
                         All three.

               Gordon STOPS.  Turns to face her.

                                     RAMIREZ (CONT'D)
                         The D.N.A. belongs to Judge Surrillo, 
                         Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

                                     GORDON
                         The Joker's telling us who he's 
                         targeting- get a unit to Surrillo's 
                         house, tell Wuertz to find Dent- get 
                         them both into protective custody.  
                         Where's the Commissioner?

                                     RAMIREZ
                         City hall.

                                     GORDON
                         Seal the building.  No one in or out 
                         till I get there.

         100   EXT. DECK, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- EVENING                      100   

               Wayne walks out to the edge of the balcony and looks over 
               Gotham.  Hears someone behind him- Rachel.

                                     RACHEL
                         Harvey may not know you well enough 
                         to understand when you're making fun 
                         of him.  But I do.

                                     WAYNE
                              (shakes his head)
                         I meant every word.

               Wayne moves closer to Rachel.  Takes her arm.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         The day you once told me about, the 
                         day when Gotham no longer needs 
                         Batman.  It's coming.

               Rachel looks at Wayne.  Conflicted.  He moves closer.

                                     RACHEL
                         You can't ask me to wait for that.

               Wayne takes Rachel's arms, looking at her, excited.

                                     WAYNE
                         It's happening now- Harvey is that 
                         hero.  He locked up half the city's 
                         criminals, and he did it without 
                         wearing a mask.  Gotham needs a hero 
                         with a face.

                                     DENT
                         You can throw a party, Wayne, I'll 
                         give you that.  Thanks again.  Mind 
                         if I borrow Rachel?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        52.


               Rachel glances back at Wayne as she moves to Dent.  Wayne 
               watches them head inside.

         101   EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING                       101   

               Two MEN in suits knock at a Brownstone.  The door is opened 
               by Judge Surrillo.  The two Men hold up BADGES.

         102   EXT. CITY HALL -- EVENING                                    102   

               Gordon enters through a tight police presence at the doors.

         103   INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING                 103   

               Gordon enters to find Loeb, flanked by armed cops.

                                     COMMISSIONER LOEB
                         Gordon, what are you playing at?

               Gordon checks the window.  Turns to his men.

                                     GORDON
                         We're secure.  I want a floor-by-
                         floor search of the entire building.
                              (turns to Loeb)
                         I'm sorry, sir.  We believe the Joker 
                         has made a threat against your life.

                                     LOEB
                         Gordon, you're unlikely to discover 
                         this for yourself, so take my word- 
                         the Police Commissioner earns a lot 
                         of threats...

               Loeb pulls a bottle of whisky and a tumbler from a drawer.

                                     LOEB (CONT'D)
                         I found the appropriate response to 
                         these situations a long time ago...

         104   EXT. STREET, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- EVENING                       104   

               The second man is waiting by the Judge's car.

                                     SURRILLO
                         Gordon wants me to go right now?

                                     MAN 1
                         These are dangerous people, Judge.  
                         Even we don't know where you're going.

               He hands Surrillo a sealed envelope.  Opens the car door.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        53.


                                     MAN 2
                         Get in, then open the envelope.  
                         It'll tell you where you're headed.

               Surrillo climbs in.  Watches them drive away.  She opens the 
               envelope- pulls out a sheet of paper.  One word on it:

               'UP'.

               Surrillo's car EXPLODES, heaving the car upwards on a 
               FIREBALL.

               A PASSERBY is thrown to the ground.  After a moment, BURNING 
               DEBRIS flutters down on him.  PLAYING CARDS.  JOKERS.

         105   INT. POLICE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS              105   

               Loeb pours himself a glass of whisky.

                                     LOEB
                         You get to explain to my wife why 
                         I'm late for dinner, Lieutenant.

                                     GORDON
                         Sir, the Joker card had a trace of 
                         your D.N.A. on it-

               A bang at the door.  Gordon pulls his weapon, then opens it.

                                     STEPHENS
                         Just the normal number of bad guys 
                         in the building- and they're all 
                         city employees.  Here's a list.

                                     LOEB
                         How'd they get my D.N.A.?

               Gordon looks at Stephens's list.

                                     GORDON
                         Somebody with access to your house 
                         or office must've lifted a tissue or 
                         a glass...

               Gordon, realizing, spins around-

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Wait-

               But Loeb is already CHOKING- he DROPS his tumbler onto the 
               desk- the spilled whiskey is SMOKING, eating into the wood.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Get a medic!

               Loeb COLLAPSES.

         106   INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- EVENING                     106   

               Dent pulls Rachel into the kitchen, away from the crowd.

                                     DENT
                         You cannot leave me on my own with 
                         these people.

                                     RACHEL
                         The whole mob's after you and you're 
                         worried about these guys?

                                     DENT
                         Compared to this, the mob doesn't 
                         scare me.  Although, I will say: 
                         them gunning for you makes you see 
                         things clearly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh, yeah?

                                     DENT
                         Yeah.  It makes you think about what 
                         you couldn't stand losing.  And who 
                         you want to spend the rest of your 
                         life with...

               Rachel looks at Dent.  Smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         The rest of your life, huh?  That's 
                         a pretty big commitment.

                                     DENT
                         Not if the mob has their way.

                                     RACHEL
                         Don't.

                                     DENT
                         Okay.  Let's be serious.  What's 
                         your answer?

               Rachel looks at him.

                                     RACHEL
                         I don't have an answer.

         107   INT. LIVING ROOM, PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                         107   

               Half the guests are on their cell phones.  An ASSISTANT DA 
               turns to his COLLEAGUE.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        55.


                                     ASSISTANT DA
                         Surrillo and Loeb?

               There is a KNOCK at the front door.  Alfred opens it- find 
               Detective Wuertz, who holds up his badge.  Alfred beckons 
               him in- there is a SHOTGUN at the back of his head held by-

               The Joker- purple suit, make up.  With friends.  The Joker 
               SMASHES Wuertz over the head- steps over him, RACKING the 
               shotgun.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Good evening.  We're the 
                         entertainment.

         108   INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                       108   

               Rachel is looking at Dent.  Torn.

                                     DENT
                         I guess no answer isn't "no".

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry, Harvey.  I just...

                                     DENT
                         It's someone else, isn't it?

               Wayne is moving up behind him.  Fast-

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Just tell me it's not Wayne.  The 
                         guy's a complete-

               Rachel's eyes go wide as Wayne puts Dent in a SLEEPER HOLD--

                                     RACHEL 
                         What are you doing?!

               Dent SLUMPS, unconscious in Wayne's arms.

                                     WAYNE
                         They've come for him.

               From the main room- A SHOTGUN BLAST followed by SCREAMS.

               Wayne stuffs Dent in a closet- puts a mop through the handles.  
               Rushes past Rachel-

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         Stay hidden.

         109   INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                 109   

               The Joker and his THUGS pour into the room, weapons raised.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        56.


         110   INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                       110   

               A THUG appears in front of Wayne, toting a shotgun.

                                     THUG
                         Hands up, pretty boy.

               Wayne FLIPS the shotgun around in the man's hands- uses it 
               as a fulcrum to SNAP his forearm- SMASHES him in the jaw 
               with the stock without breaking step, field stripping the 
               shotgun and tossing the pieces in different directions.

         111   INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                 111   

               The Joker moves through the terrified guests.  Smiling.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I only have one question: where is 
                         Harvey Dent?
                              (silence)
                         I'll settle for his loved ones...

               A distinguished Gentleman steps into the Joker's path.

                                     GENTLEMAN
                         We're not intimidated by thugs.

               The Joker stops.  Stares at the man.  SMILES AFFECTIONATELY.

                                     THE JOKER
                         You know, you remind me of my father.
                              (GRABS him)
                         I hated my father.

               The Joker has his blade in the Gentleman's mouth.

                                     RACHEL
                         Stop!

               The Joker drops the Gentleman.  Turns to Rachel.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Hello, beautiful.  You must be 
                         Harvey's squeeze.
                              (runs his knife across 
                              her cheek)
                         And you are beautiful.  You look 
                         nervous- it's the scars isn't it?  
                         Wanna know how I got them?  I had a 
                         wife, beautiful like you.  Who tells 
                         me I worry too much.  Who says I 
                         need to smile more.  Who gambles.  
                         And gets in deep with the sharks.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         One day they carve her face, and 
                         we've got no money for surgeries.  
                         She can't take it.
                              (presses knife into 
                              her cheek)
                         I just want to see her smile again.  
                         I just want her to know I don't care 
                         about the scars.  So I put a razor 
                         in my mouth and do this to myself... 
                         And you know what?
                              (starts laughing)
                         She can't stand the sight of me...
                              (or crying)
                         She leaves!  See, now I see the funny 
                         side.  Now I'm always smiling.

         112   INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                112   

               Wayne walks in.  A COUPLE are hastily putting themselves 
               back together, alerted by the noise.

                                     MALE GUEST
                         What's going on out there, Wayne?

               Wayne doesn't answer.  He walks into a closet and pulls at a 
               FALSE WALL.  Wayne steps into the safe room.

                                     FEMALE GUEST
                         Thank god- you've got a panic room.

               The door SLAMS shut and seals with a HISS.

                                     MALE GUEST
                         Wait!  You can't-

                                     FEMALE GUEST
                         You've got to be kidding me.

         113   INT. LIVING ROOM, WAYNE'S PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                 113   

               The Joker raises his knife from Rachel's cheek.  She SLUGS 
               him.  He smiles.

                                     THE JOKER
                         A little fight in you.  I like that.

                                     BATMAN
                         Then you're going to love me.

               The Joker turns.  Batman catches him with a BLOW, spins him 
               down and DISARMS him- the Joker's men jump him- Batman takes 
               them out two at a time- DISARMING thugs- BREAKING forearms--
               the Joker CLICKS a BLADE from the toe of his shoe and KICKS-
               JABBING BETWEEN THE PLATES OF ARMOR covering Batman's ribcage-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        58.


               Batman HURLS the Joker across the room.  One of the Joker's 
               men LUNGES- Batman lays him out cold.

               The Joker has another knife pressed to Rachel's neck.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         Drop the knife.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Sure.  Just take off your mask and 
                         show us all who you are...

               Rachel shakes her head at Batman.  The Joker raises his 
               shotgun to the side and BLOWS OUT the pane of glass next to 
               him.  The Joker dangles Rachel out the window.

                                     BATMAN
                         Let her go.

                                     THE JOKER
                              (laughs)
                         Very poor choice of words...

               He lets her DROP- Rachel falls onto a SLOPING GLASS ROOF- 
               sliding towards the edge.  Batman DIVES after her-

         114   EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT                                       114   

               They DROP- Batman FIRES his grapple, SNAGGING Rachel's ankle- 
               activates one wing of his cape- They SPIN and SLOW- Batman 
               envelopes Rachel- they SLAM into the hood of a passing taxi.

         115   INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS                                      115   

               The DRIVER SCREAMS as Batman and Rachel hit the roof- ROLL 
               down the windshield- onto the pavement.  Alive.

         116   INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS                                       116   

               The Joker looks back as his car SPEEDS away.  He's breathing 
               hard, EXHILARATED.  He touches the blood running down his 
               sweaty white makeup.  SMACKS the back of the driver's seat-

                                     DRIVER
                         What do we do about Dent?

                                     THE JOKER
                         I'm a man of my word.

         117   EXT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS                                      117   

               Rachel opens her eyes.

                                     BATMAN
                         Are you alright?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        59.


                                     RACHEL
                         Let's not do that again, okay?
                              (looks around)
                         Is Harvey-?

                                     BATMAN
                         He's safe.

               Rachel lies back, breathing.  Looks up at Batman.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

         118   INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY                118   

               STEPHENS is talking to Gordon, subdued.

                                     STEPHENS
                         Jim, it's over.

                                     GORDON
                         As long as they don't get to Lau, 
                         we've cut off their funds.

                                     STEPHENS
                         But the prosecution's over.

                                     STEPHENS (CONT'D)
                         No-one's standing up in front of a 
                         Judge while judges and police 
                         commissioners are getting blown away.

                                     GORDON
                         What about Dent?

                                     STEPHENS
                         If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway 
                         to Mexico by now.

               The door BURSTS OPEN.  Dent.  Fire in his eyes.

                                     DENT
                         So where do you keep your trash?

               Gordon looks at Dent.  Impressed.

         119   INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY        119   

               Lau looks up as Dent walks in, holding a bullet proof vest.

                                     DENT
                         You're due in court- I need you alive 
                         long enough to get you on the record.

                                     LAU
                         No way.  You can't protect me- you 
                         can't even protect yourselves.

               Dent THROWS the heavy vest at Lau.

                                     DENT
                         Refuse to cooperate on the stand- 
                         you won't be coming back here- you'll 
                         go to county.  How long do you 
                         calculate you'll last in there?

         120   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY                                       120   

               Wayne sits at his video screens- they all play the Joker's 
               video with different IMAGE TREATMENTS and SOUND TUNINGS.

               Wayne turns to Alfred.  Indicates the screens.

                                     WAYNE
                         Targeting me won't get their money 
                         back.  I knew the mob wouldn't go 
                         down without a fight, but this is 
                         different.  They've crossed a line.

                                     ALFRED
                         You crossed it first, sir.  You've 
                         hammered them, squeezed them to the 
                         point of desperation.  And now, in 
                         their desperation they've turned to 
                         a man they don't fully understand.

               Wayne gets up from his monitors, raises the bat-cabinet.

                                     WAYNE
                         Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.  
                         We just have to figure out what he's 
                         after.

                                     ALFRED
                         Respectfully, Master Wayne, perhaps 
                         this is a man you don't fully 
                         understand, either.
                              (looks at Wayne)
                         I was in Burma.  A long time ago.  
                         My friends and I were working for 
                         the local government.  They were 
                         trying to buy the loyalty of tribal 
                         leaders, bribing them with precious 
                         stones.  But their caravans were 
                         being raided in a forest north of 
                         Rangoon by a bandit.  We were asked 
                         to take care of the problem, so we 
                         started looking for the stones.

                         But after six months, we couldn't 
                         find anyone who had traded with him.

                                     WAYNE
                         What were you missing?

                                     ALFRED
                         One day I found a child playing with 
                         a ruby as big as a tangerine.
                              (shrugs)
                         The bandit had been throwing the 
                         stones away.

                                     WAYNE
                         So why was he stealing them?

                                     ALFRED
                         Because he thought it was good sport.  
                         Because some men aren't looking for 
                         anything logical, like money... they 
                         can't be bought, bullied, reasoned 
                         or negotiated with.
                              (grave)
                         Some men just want to watch the world 
                         burn.

               Wayne stares at Alfred.  Reaches for the bat-suit.

         121   EXT. SKYLINE OF GOTHAM -- DAWN                               121   

               MOVING over the city we hear myriad RADIO CALLS going out 
               over the ether.  CLOSE IN on a lonely figure on top of a 
               skyscraper.  The Batman.  Listening with his million dollar 
               earpieces.  From the babble, ONE VOICE EMERGES.

                                     DISPATCH (O.S.)
                         Your name, sir.  Please state-

                         8th at orchard.  You'll find Harvey 
                         Dent there.

         122   EXT. 8TH STREET AT ORCHARD -- DAWN                           122   

               An UNMARKED and a SQUAD CAR screech to a halt.  Gordon and 
               Ramirez get out, lead two UNIFORMS into the building.

         123   INT. APARTMENT, EIGHT AVE. -- CONTINUOUS                     123   

               The door SMASHES OPEN, Gordon- gun drawn- takes in the scene.

               TWO DEAD MEN sitting at the kitchen table.  They each have a 
               HAND OF CARDS, as if in the middle of a game.  ALL JOKERS.

               Gordon and Ramirez STARE at the CRUDE LEERS carved into their 
               faces.  Their DRIVERS LICENSES are pinned to their chests.

                         I need ten minutes with the scene 
                         before your men contaminate it.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Us contaminate it?  It's because of 
                         you that these guys are dead in the 
                         first place-

                                     GORDON
                         Ramirez.

               She stands down.  Batman moves past the bodies to the wall.

               Finds an embedded stray bullet.  He pulls a SAWING DEVICE 
               from his belt- THRUSTS it into the wall and starts cutting 
               around the bullet.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         That's brick- you're gonna try and 
                         take ballistics off a shattered 
                         bullet?

                                     BATMAN
                         No.  Fingerprints.

               Ramirez looks at Gordon.  Is he serious?  Gordon points-

                                     GORDON
                         Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast, 
                         'cos we know his next target...

               Batman looks- a campaign poster: RE-ELECT MAYOR GARCIA.  The 
               Mayor's image has a MANIC CLOWN'S GRIN and "HA,HA,HA".

               Fox is at his desk.  Reese enters.

                         You asked me to do the diligence on 
                         the L.S.I. Holdings deal again.  I 
                         found irregularities.

                                     FOX
                         Their CEO is in police custody.

                                     REESE
                         Not with their numbers.  With yours.  
                         A whole division of Wayne Industries 
                         disappeared, overnight.  So I went 
                         down to the archives and started 
                         pulling old files.

               He pulls out a folded blueprint.  Slides it across the desk.

                                     REESE (CONT'D)
                         My kids love the Batman.  I thought 
                         he was pretty cool, too.  Out there, 
                         kicking some ass.

               Fox picks up the piece of paper.  Unfolds it.  It's an old 
               BLUEPRINT.  The image is unmistakable: THE TUMBLER.

               Reese points to the approval box in the corner of the page.

                         Your project.  Don't tell me you 
                         didn't recognize your baby pancaking 
                         cop cars on the evening news.  Now 
                         you're getting sloppy.  Applied 
                         Sciences was a small, dead department- 
                         who'd notice?  But now you've got 
                         the entire R and D department burning 
                         cash, claiming it's related to cell 
                         phones for the army.  What are you 
                         building him now?  A rocket ship?  I

                         rest of my life.

               Fox looks at him.  Even.  Folds up the blueprint.

               Reese stares at Fox.  Who smiles.  And slides the blueprint 
               across the desk.

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         Good luck.

               Reese looks at it.  Then at Fox.  Swallows.  Slides it back.

         125   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAY                                       125   

               Wayne hands Alfred a RIFLE BULLET scribed with a GRID.  He 
               slots it into a clip, then loads it into a COMPUTER CONTROLLED 
               GATTLING GUN.  He puts on ear protectors.  Hits a button.

               The rifle WHIRS to life- dollying sideways, BLASTING BULLETS 
               into a series of identical BRICK WALL SAMPLES.

                                     ALFRED
                         I'm not sure you made it loud enough, 
                         sir.

               As the wall samples still smoke, Wayne steps up, carrying 
               the sample from the crime scene.  Comparing its spread to 
               the new samples, he selects two and carries them to an X-RAY 
               SCANNER.

               The machine gives the samples a 3-axis scan- HI-RES 3-D IMAGES 
               of the bullet fragment arrays come up on the screen...

         126   INT. APPLIED SCIENCES DIVISION -- DAY                        126   

               The same image of the bullet fragment on a screen.  Fox hits 
               a key and the computer 'reassembles' the bullets according 
               to the identifying grid on each fragment.

                         A bullet fragment array pops on 
                         screen.

                         Here's it reverse-engineered...

               Fox hits a button and the unmarked bullet fragments are 
               reassembled.  Wayne spins the roughly-shaped bullet puzzle-

                                     WAYNE
                         And here's a thumb print.

               Fox looks at the screen, impressed.  Thinks.

                                     FOX
                         I'll make you a copy.
                              (troubled)
                         Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R and D?

                                     WAYNE
                         Yes.  Government telecommunications 
                         project.

                         I wasn't aware we had any new 
                         government contracts.  Can you-

                                     WAYNE
                         Lucius.  I'm playing this one pretty 
                         close to the chest.

                                     FOX
                         Fair enough.

               Fox looks at Wayne as he leaves.  Uneasy.

         127   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- CONTINUOUS -- INTERCUT                    127   

               Wayne examines the fingerprint-

                                     WAYNE
                         I've run it through all the databases 
                         and came up with four possibles.

               Wayne gets up to let Alfred sit.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         Cross-reference the addresses.  Look 
                         for Parkside and around.

               Wayne opens a HYDRAULIC DOOR, revealing a gleaming MV AUGUSTA 
               BRUTALE.  As he moves the bike onto the lift...

                                     ALFRED
                         Got one.  Melvin White, aggravated 
                         assault, moved to Arkham twice- 1502 
                         Randolph Apartments, just off State-

                         Overlooking the parade.

               Wayne and the bike rise on the lift.

         128   EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- DAY                                  128   

               The avenue has been blocked off.  Onlookers line the 
               sidewalks.  POLICE march past in dress uniform.  Engel does 
               a stand-up on the sidewalk.

                                     ENGEL
                         With no word from the Batman- even 
                         as they mourn Commissioner Loeb, 
                         these cops have to be wondering if 
                         the Joker is going to make good on 
                         his threat to kill the Mayor today...

               On the buildings above, POLICE SNIPERS scan the crowd.

               Gordon keys his radio-

                                     GORDON
                         How's it looking up top?

                                     POLICE SNIPER
                         We're tight.  But frankly... there's 
                         a lot of windows up here.

               Gordon looks up at the myriad buildings overlooking the 
               podium.

         129   EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS                            129   

               Wayne maneuvers the Ducati through the traffic.  He pulls up 
               near a parade barricade- dismounts and slips into an alley.

         130   INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS                                  130   

               Some of the building's hard-luck TENANTS eye Wayne as he 
               counts doors down the hallway.  He finds 1502...

         131   EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- LATER                                131   

               A SEA OF POLICE fills the Avenue.  In the center, three 
               grieving families and an HONOR GUARD.  The Mayor at the 
               podium.  Gordon behind.  Dent is seated with Rachel.

                                     MAYOR
                         ...and as we recognize the sacrifice 
                         of these officers, we must remember 
                         that vigilance is the price of safety.

         132   INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS                                  132   

               Wayne enters: EIGHT MEN IN UNDERSHIRTS, bound, gagged, 
               blindfolded.  A SNIPER SCOPE on a tripod at the window.

               Wayne moves to the first man, RIPS the tape from his mouth.

         133   EXT. PARKSIDE AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS                           133   

               Gordon scans the crowd.  The Mayor wraps up- the Honor Guard 
               steps forward, raises weapons...

         134   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS              134   

               A POLICE SNIPER scans the windows of the tenement...

         135   INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS                                  135   

               Wayne RACES to the window, looks through the SCOPE to see:

         136   EXT. STATE STREET -- CONTINUOUS                              136   

               THE HONOR GUARD TURN THEIR WEAPONS ON THE MAYOR.  One SMILES, 
               flesh-colored makeup over his scars.  THE JOKER.

               Gordon LEAPS FORWARD- they FIRE- GORDON TAKES SHOTS TO THE

               BACK as he SLAMS the Mayor to the ground-

         137   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS              137   

               The Police Sniper SPOTS Wayne at the window- SHOOTS

         138   INT. TENEMENT -- CONTINUOUS                                  138   

               Wayne DUCKS as SHOTS erupt around the window-

         139   EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS                                  139   

               PANDEMONIUM erupts-One of the honor guard is TAGGED IN THE 
               LEG- GOES DOWN.  The others MELT into the CHAOS.

               On the podium, Stephens rolls Gordon over... he is not moving.

         140   EXT. SIDE STREET OFF PARKSIDE -- MOMENTS LATER               140   

               CHAOS.  Dent approaches an ambulance sitting in the alley.

               Two cops jump out and run over to their commander.  Dent 
               steps up into the back.

         141   INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS                                 141   

               The Joker's thug sits there.  Handcuffed.  A PARAMEDIC 
               bandages his leg.  Cops run past, barking orders.

                                                                        68.


                                     DENT
                         Tell me what you know about the Joker.

               The Joker's thug looks at Dent.  Smirks.  Dent looks down.

               Exasperated.  Looks back up at the Joker's Thug.  Spots 
               something- moves closer- the man's uniform... his name tag...

               OFFICER RACHEL DAWES.

               Dent, breathing hard, looks around: the paramedic jumps out, 
               rushing to help a FALLEN OFFICER.  Dent spies the keys in 
               the ignition.  Jumps into the driver's seat...

         142   EXT. GORDON'S HOUSE -- DUSK                                  142   

               Barbara Gordon stands in the doorway, scared.  Stephens and 
               a UNIFORMED OFFICER stand in front of her.

                                     STEPHENS
                         I'm sorry, Barbara.

               James Gordon pushes past his mother to look at Stephens.

               Barbara tries to push him back inside.

                                     BARBARA
                         Jimmy, go play with your sister...

               James stays just inside the door.

                                     STEPHENS
                         I'm sorry.

               Barbara stares at Stephens.  Then looks past him.

                                     BARBARA
                         Are you out there?!  Are you?!

               James spots something- Batman, perched in the shadows.

                                     BARBARA (CONT'D)
                         You brought this on us!  This 
                         craziness!  You did!  You brought 
                         this...!

               She collapses into Stephens's arms.  Batman hangs his head.

               Strobe lights.  Pounding music.  Maroni is in a booth at the 
               side with his MISTRESS.  His bodyguards are around the table.

                         What?!

               One of Maroni's Bodyguards DROPS- Maroni looks over- in the 
               strobe lights- Batman SAVAGES his bodyguards- people RUN, 
               TERRIFIED.  Maroni starts to get out of his seat- Batman 
               LANDS like a panther on the table in front of him-

               Rachel moves through the chaotic bullpen at MCU- EYEWITNESSES, 
               civilian and cop are being questioned.

               Rachel's phone rings.

                         Okay.  Go straight there.  Don't 
                         tell anyone where you're going.  
                         I'll find you there.

               Wider shows us we are-

         146   INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS              146   

                                     DENT
                         I love you.

               Dent hangs up the phone.  TAPED to a chair in front of Dent- 
               the Joker's Thug, blindfolded.  Dent RIPS off the blindfold...

         147   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT                                    147   

               Maroni opens his eyes.  Batman is holding him by the collar.

                                     BATMAN
                         I want the Joker.

                                     MARONI
                              (looks down)
                         From one professional to another- if 
                         you're trying to scare someone, pick 
                         a better spot.  From this height the 
                         fall wouldn't kill me.

                                                                        71.


                                     BATMAN
                         I'm counting on it.

               Batman lets go.  Maroni FALLS.  And SCREAMS.

         148   EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT                                       148   

               Maroni NAILS the pavement.  CLUTCHES at his leg, which is 
               badly broken.  Batman FLIES down, landing over him- hauls 
               him up.  Maroni HOLLERS in pain.

                                     BATMAN
                         Where is he?

                                     MARONI
                         Don't know, he found us-

                                     BATMAN
                         He must have friends.

                                     MARONI
                         Friends?  You met this guy?

                                     BATMAN
                         Someone knows where he is.

               Maroni looks up at Batman.  Sneering.

                                     MARONI
                         No one's gonna tell you anything- 
                         they're wise to your act- you got 
                         rules... the Joker, he's got no rules.  
                         No one's gonna cross him for you.  
                         You want this guy, you got one way.  
                         And you already know what that is.  
                         Just take off that mask and let him 
                         come find you.

               Batman DROPS Maroni.

                                     MARONI (CONT'D)
                         Or you want to let a couple more 
                         people get killed while you make up 
                         your mind?

         149   INT. BASEMENT, CONDEMNED BUILDING -- NIGHT                   149   

               Dent shows the Joker's Thug a GUN.  Bullets.  Loads the gun.  
               SHOVES it in his face-

                                     DENT
                         You wanna play games?

               Dent PUSHES the gun against the thug's head with REAL MALICE.  
               Pulls it away and FIRES.  The Thug FLINCHES.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        72.


               Dent puts the gun barrel against the thug's temple-

                                     JOKER'S THUG
                              (rattled)
                         You wouldn't...

               And pulls his lucky coin out of his pocket.

                                     DENT
                         No.  I wouldn't.  That's why I'm not 
                         going to leave it up to me.
                              (shows him coin)
                         Heads- you get to keep your head.  
                         Tails... not so lucky.  So, you want 
                         to tell me about the Joker?

               The Thug, scared, says nothing.  Dent FLICKS the coin into 
               the air.  SLAPS it onto the back of his gun hand (aiming 
               with wrist horizontal).  Dent shows him the coin.  Heads.  
               The Thug exhales, SHAKING.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Go again?

                                     JOKER'S THUG
                              (sobbing)
                         I don't know anything!

                                     DENT
                         You're not playing the odds, friend.

               Dent tosses the coin again.  This time IT DOESN'T LAND.  
               Dent

               Looks up.  Batman is there.

                                     BATMAN
                         You'd leave a man's life to chance?

                                     DENT
                         Not exactly.

                                     BATMAN
                         His name's Schiff, Thomas.  He's a 
                         paranoid schizophrenic, a former 
                         patient at Arkham.  The kind of mind 
                         the Joker attracts.

               Batman moves away from Schiff.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         What do expect to learn from him?

               Dent is shivering with frustration.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        73.


                                     DENT
                         The Joker killed Gordon- and, and 
                         Loeb.  He's going to kill Rachel...

                                     BATMAN
                         You're the symbol of hope that I 
                         could never be.  Your stand against 
                         organized crime is the first 
                         legitimate ray of light in Gotham 
                         for decades.  If anyone saw this, 
                         everything would be undone- all the 
                         criminals you got off the streets 
                         would be released.  And Jim Gordon 
                         will have died for nothing.

               Batman hands Dent his lucky coin.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         You're going to call a press 
                         conference.  Tomorrow morning.

                                     DENT
                         Why?

                                     BATMAN
                         No one else will die because of me.  
                         Gotham is in your hands, now.

                                     DENT
                         You can't!  You can't give in!

               But Batman is gone.

         150   INT. BEDROOM, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- NIGHT                       150   

               Rachel watches Gotham through the window.  Wayne enters.

                                     RACHEL
                         Harvey called.  He says Batman is 
                         going to turn himself in.

                                     WAYNE
                         I have no choice.

                                     RACHEL
                         You honestly think it's going to 
                         stop the Joker from killing?

                                     WAYNE
                         Perhaps not.  But I've got enough 
                         blood on my hands.  I've seen, now, 
                         what I would have to become to stop 
                         men like him.

               Rachel looks at Wayne.  She cannot help him.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         You once told me that if the day 
                         came when I was finished...

               Wayne moves towards her.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         We'd be together.

                                     RACHEL
                         Bruce, don't make me your one hope 
                         for a normal life-

               Wayne takes her in his arms.

                                     WAYNE
                         But did you mean it?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

               They kiss.  Then separate.  She looks sadly into his eyes.

                                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
                         But they won't let us be together 
                         after you turn yourself in.

               Wayne nods.  Leaves.  She watches him go.

         151   INT. BAT-BUNKER -- DAWN                                      151   

               Alfred shovels DOCUMENTS into an incinerator- blueprints, 
               designs, files.  He pauses, looking down at a book.

                                     ALFRED
                         Even the logs?

                                     WAYNE
                         Anything that could lead back to 
                         Lucius or Rachel.

               Alfred tosses the book onto the fire.  STARES at Wayne.

                                     WAYNE (CONT'D)
                         People are dying, Alfred.  What would 
                         you have me do?

               Alfred looks into Wayne's eyes with a fearsome gaze.

                                     ALFRED
                         Endure, Master Wayne.  Take it.  
                         They'll hate you for it, but that's 
                         the point of Batman... he can be the 
                         outcast.  He can make the choice no 
                         one else can face.  The right choice.

               Wayne shakes his head.

                                     WAYNE
                         Today I've found out what Batman 
                         can't do.  He can't endure this.
                              (rueful smile)
                         Today you get to say II told you 
                         so'.

                                     ALFRED
                         Today, I don't want to.
                              (beat)
                         Although I did bloody tell you.

               Wayne sinks the Bat-suit, Alfred closes the incinerator.

               They head for the lift.

                                     ALFRED (CONT'D)
                         I suppose they'll lock me up as well.  
                         Your accomplice.

                                     WAYNE
                         Accomplice?  I'm going to tell them 
                         the whole thing was your idea.

               They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.

         152   INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- DAY                       152   

               A capacity crowd of REPORTERS, COPS, and PUBLIC.  Dent is at 
               the podium.  Wayne sits in the crowd.

                                     DENT
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for 
                         coming.  I've called this press 
                         conference for two reasons.  Firstly, 
                         to assure the citizens of Gotham 
                         that everything that can be done 
                         over the Joker killing is being done.  
                         Secondly, because the Batman has 
                         offered to turn himself in-

               The crowd REACTS

                                     HECKLER 
                         So where is he?!

                                     DENT
                         But first.  Let's consider the 
                         situation: should we give in to this 
                         terrorist's demands?  Do we really 
                         think that-

                                     REPORTER
                         You'd rather protect an outlaw 
                         vigilante than the lives of citizens?!

               The crowd noisily assents.  Dent calmly motions quiet.

                                     DENT
                         The Batman is an outlaw...

         153   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                           153   

               Rachel is watching the press conference on TV.

                                     DENT (O.S.)
                         But that's not why we're demanding 
                         he turn himself in.  We're doing it 
                         because we're scared.  We've been 
                         happy to let Batman clean up our
                         Streets for us until now-

         154   INT. PRESS ROOM, SUPERIOR COURT -- CONTINUOUS                154   

                                     HECKLER
                         Things are worse than ever!

               Wayne looks at the Heckler.  At the angry crowd.  Dent leans 
               over the podium.  Impassioned.

                                     DENT
                         Yes.  They are.  But the night is 
                         darkest just before the dawn.  And I 
                         promise you, the dawn is coming.
                              (the crowd quiets)
                         One day, the Batman will have to 
                         answer for the laws he's broken- but 
                         to us, not to this madman.

               The crowd seems moved by his words, then, a CHANT-

                                     COP HECKLER
                         NO MORE DEAD COPS!!

               Appreciative noise.

                                     REPORTER
                         WHERE IS THE BATMAN?

               People take up the chant.  Dent has lost them.  He knows it.

                                     DENT
                         So be it.
                              (turns to officers)
                         Take the Batman into custody.

               At this, a HUSH DESCENDS.  Wayne is sitting towards the back.

               Hungry eyes scan the room.  Wayne starts to rise... DENT 
               OFFERS HIS OWN WRISTS TO THE OFFICERS

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         I am the Batman.

               A beat.  Wayne stares.

         155   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                           155   

               Rachel STARES as Dent is arrested on TV.  Appalled.

         156   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAY                                  156   

               Rachel comes up to Alfred.  Upset.

                                     RACHEL
                         Why is he letting Harvey do this, 
                         Alfred?

                                     ALFRED
                         I don't know.  He went down to the 
                         press conference-

                                     RACHEL
                         And just stood by?!

                                     ALFRED
                         Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent 
                         believe that Batman stands for 
                         something more important than a 
                         terrorist's whims, Miss Dawes, even 
                         if everyone hates him for it.

                                     DENT
                         That's the sacrifice he's making- to 
                         not be a hero.  To be something more.

                                     RACHEL
                         Well, you're right about one thing- 
                         letting Harvey take the fall is not 
                         heroic.

               Rachel holds out an ENVELOPE.

                                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
                         You know Bruce best, Alfred... give 
                         it to him when the time is right.

                                     ALFRED
                         How will I know?

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not sealed.

               Alfred takes the envelope.  Rachel gives him a kiss.

                                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
                         Goodbye, Alfred.

                                     ALFRED
                         Goodbye, Rachel.

         157   INT. CELL, MCU -- EVENING                                    157   

               A Detective unlocks the cell and lets Rachel inside.

                                     DENT
                         I'm sorry, I didn't have time to 
                         talk this through with you.

                                     RACHEL
                         Don't offer yourself as bait, Harvey.

                                     DENT
                         They're transferring me to central 
                         holding.  This is the Joker's chance, 
                         and when he attacks, Batman will 
                         take him down.

                                     RACHEL
                         No.  This is too dangerous-

               The Detective knocks.  Dent rises.

         158   EXT. COURTYARD MCU -- EVENING                                158   

               Detectives stare at Dent as he is led, shackled, to the 
               waiting CONVOY.  Stephens begins CLAPPING- a handful join 
               in, but most remain silent.  Rachel follows him to the back 
               of an armored vehicle.

                                     RACHEL
                         He's using you as bait- but he doesn't 
                         know if he can get the Joker- he's 
                         failed so far.

                                     DENT
                         How do you know what he's thinking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat)
                         I just do, okay?  Harvey, this isn't 
                         just about you, what about all the 
                         people counting on you to turn this 
                         city around?  Tell everyone the truth-

               Dent kisses her.  Pulls out his LUCKY COIN-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                     DENT 
                         Heads I go through with it.

                                     RACHEL
                         This is your life... you don't leave 
                         something like this to chance...

               Dent tosses it at her- Rachel catches it.  Looks.  Heads.

                                     DENT
                              (sincere)
                         I'm not.

               She turns it over: IT IS DOUBLE-HEADED.  She looks up- the 
               DOORS CLOSE on his smile.  She shakes her head.  Torn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You make your own luck.

               As SWATS file into the back of the support vehicles-

                                     ACTING COMISSIONER
                         We get this guy to County and he's 
                         their problem.  The streets along 
                         your route will be cleared.  The 
                         convoy stops FOR NO REASON...

         159   INT. ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                               159   

               A Swat with a shotgun climbs into the cab.  Pulls on his 
               mask.  Looks over at the DRIVER, who's already wearing his.

                                     SHOTGUN SWAT
                         Hope you've got some moves.

         160   EXT. TENTH AVENUE, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS                    160   

               The convoy ROCKETS past a roadblock.

         161   INT. ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                               161   

               The Swats are staring at Dent, fascinated.  He smiles.

         162   EXT. INTERSECTION -- CONTINUOUS                              162   

               An Officer holding up traffic.  A TRUCK pulls up.

                                     OFFICER
                         You wait like everybody else, pal.

               A SHOTGUN BLAST sends the Officer flying.  A second blast 
               illuminates the shooter's face: the Joker.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        80.


         163   INT. LEAD PATROL CAR, CONVOY -- CONTINUOUS                   163   

               The SWAT behind the wheel of the lead black-and-white slows 
               as he sees something burning in the intersection ahead.

         164   EXT. AVENUE -- CONTINUOUS                                    164   

               Overhead, a police HELICOPTER checks the route, hovering 
               above a burning FIRE TRUCK, BLOCKING the road.

         165   INT. ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                               165   

               The Driver is all business.  The radio CRACKLES.

                                     RADIO
                         All units, be advised.  All units 
                         will exit down Cheviot west and 
                         proceed north on lower 5th avenue.

                                     SHOTGUN SWAT
                         Lower 5th?  We'll be like ducks in a 
                         barrel down there.

         166   EXT. SURFACE STREETS -- CONTINUOUS                           166   

               The convoy disappears down the exit ramp.

         167   EXT. LOWER FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT                             167   

               The convoy rolls through the subterranean streets.  A GARBAGE 
               TRUCK pulls up behind and casually SWIPES the rear vehicles 
               of the convoy off the road...

         168   INT. ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                               168   

                                     SHOTGUN SWAT
                         Get us out of here!

               The Driver NAILS the gas-

         169   EXT. LOWER FIFTH -- CONTINUOUS                               169   

               The Garbage Truck pushes hard on the armored car, ramming 
               its rear bumper, FORCING it forward.

         170   INT. ARMORED CAR -- NIGHT                                    170   

               The Driver watches the Truck fill his rear view.  Shotgun 
               Swat picks up the radio.

                                     SHOTGUN SWAT
                         We've got company back here-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        81.


         171   EXT. LOWER FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT                             171   

               A SECOND TRUCK SMASHES into the SWAT van at the head of the 
               convoy, SMASHING it through the concrete barriers and INTO 
               THE RIVER.  The truck is branded "LAUGHTER" but an "S" has 
               been sprayed at the front to make "SLAUGHTER" with "HA, HA, 
               HA" all over the side...

               The Joker's Truck DODGES between the support columns and 
               into the oncoming lane- pulls alongside the armored car.

               The Driver looks over.  The cargo door on the truck slides 
               open.  Inside, the Joker, holding a machine gun.

               The armored car LOCKS up its brakes, but the garbage truck 
               pushes it forward as the Joker fires- BULLETS slamming into

               The side of the vehicle-

         172   INT. REAR CABIN, ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                   172   

               Dent is calm as the SWATS FLINCH from the bullet indentations-

         173   INT. UP FRONT, ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                     173   

               Shotgun SWAT STARES at the Joker.

         174   INT. REAR TRAILER OF TRUCK -- NIGHT                          174   

               The Joker drops his machine gun and picks up an RPG.  He 
               stops- SEES something up ahead, racing towards the second 
               truck- the BATMOBILE.  The Joker stares, fascinated, as-

         175   EXT. LOWER FIFTH -- CONTINUOUS                               175   

               -THE BATMOBILE PLOWS STRAIGHT INTO THE SECOND TRUCK- the low-
               profile car sending the truck UP INTO THE CONCRETE CEILING-
               the Batmobile carries on through, as the TRUCK DISINTEGRATES.

         176   INT. TRUCK -- NIGHT                                          176   

               The Joker looks back to the batmobile, amused.

                                     JOKER'S THUG
                         Is that him-?

                                     THE JOKER
                         Anyone could be driving that thing-
                         stay on Dent.

               The Joker lines up his RPG and prepares to fire-

               Shotgun SWAT's eyes go wide at the Joker's weapon- the Driver

               The Armored Car CRASHES BACK against the Garbage Truck,                        
               BRAKING, SCRAPING, SLOWING just enough- the RPG SLAMS into 
               the SQUAD CAR in front of them and EXPLODES- the armored car 
               BURSTS through the fireball and continues.

         179   EXT. LOWER FIFTH -- CONTINUOUS                               179

               Batman watches as the Joker prepares to fire.  Several rows

               The Joker steadies the RPG and FIRES- the Batmobile CRASHES 
               down into the open space between the two vehicles- taking 
               the hit from the RPG which EXPLODES- 

               The rear of the Batmobile EXPLODES- SPINNING the FLAMING car-

               The Batmobile flips over to come to rest in a smoking heap- 
               the front end intact, rear wheels scattered across the 
               roadway.  A small crowd gathers.

               The Joker JUMPS down from the truck, still giggling like a 
               kid- looks back at the Batmobile's destruction-

                                     THE JOKER
                         Whoever he was... he ain't now.

               The Joker YANKS his dead driver out of the cab, JUMPS over 
               him to take the wheel and pull back onto the roadway.

                         Let's get topside- we need that air

                         Damage catastrophic.  Initiate eject

               The crowd JUMPS- PANELS of the front of the car BLOW OUT- 
               The crowd stares, OPEN-MOUTHED, as Batman EMERGES, HOISTED 
               UP AND OUT of the flaming car by the FRONT POD- LEVERING 
               OVER the FRONT WHEEL... the pod PUSHES the OTHER WHEEL IN 
               FRONT to form a type of MOTORCYCLE- The BAT-POD SHOOTS 
               FORWARD, bursting free as the Batmobile DETONATES, DYING in 
               a MASSIVE FIREBALL... Batman's cape SUCKS TOGETHER, forming 
               a TIGHT PACK on his shoulders, clear of the CHURNING REAR 
               TIRE of the bat-pod...

         196   EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS                                  196   

               The armored car races down the street- the CHOPPER dips low.

                                     PILOT
                         We're back on point- and ready to 
                         give some of their own medicine-

               Cop pulls out an ASSAULT RIFLE.  COCKS it-

               The Joker FIGHTS with the truck's gearbox, turns to his Thug-

                         Tee 'em up.

         201   INT. PASSENGER CAR, LOWER LEVEL STREET -- NIGHT              201   

               A motorist stares through his rear-view mirror, transfixed, 
               as the bat-pod TEARS past.  He YELPS as the bat-pod SMASHES 
               the wing mirror from his car.

         202   EXT. LOWER LEVEL STREET -- NIGHT                             202   

               Batman accelerates, oblivious to the STACCATO of CLEAVED 
               wing mirrors as the bat-pod RAZORS through traffic- CROSSES 
               a BUSY INTERSECTION- The bat-pod CUTS off the crowded lower 
               level street, ROARING over into the PARKING LANES-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        85.


               Batman squeezes his triggers- BLASTING at PARKED CARS, BLOWING 
               them out of the way, literally CANNONING A PATH for the pod...

         203   EXT. TRAIN STATION -- CONTINUOUS                             203   

               The Bat-Pod CANNONS through the glass doors and RACES through 
               the stationmall- COMMUTERS screaming and diving out of the 
               way-

               The Bat-Pod races up the stairs and onto the upper street-

         204   EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS                                  204   

               The Joker's Thugs FIRE THE CABLES ACROSS THE STREET AT SEVENTH 
               FLOOR LEVEL... they pull TAUT as the Chopper approaches, 
               unawares... the Chopper CATCHES on the cables, GOING DOWN in 
               a FIERY BALL that BARRELS along the street towards the armored 
               car...

         205   INT. ARMORED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                               205   

               The Driver steers around the flaming wreckage as the Shotgun

         206   EXT. NARROW ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS                              206   

               The Bat-pod TEARS down a narrow alley blocked with DUMPSTERS- 
               CANNONS the dumpsters to make a path-

         207   INT. CAB OF JOKER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT                           207   

               The Joker hands the wheel to his man- takes a submachine gun-

                                     THUG
                         Boss?

               The Joker looks ahead to see the Bat-pod emerge from the 
               alley in a cloud of fire, SKIDDING SIDEWAYS IMPOSSIBLY- it 
               RACES TOWARDS THEM- 

                                     THE JOKER
                         Guess it was him.

         208   EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT                                       208   

               The Bat-pod RACES straight at the Joker's truck- FIRES A 
               HARPOON at the Joker's truck- it IMPACTS low, below the bumper-

         209   INT. TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS                                     209   

               The Joker's Thug DUCKS, then comes back up, beaming.

                                     JOKER'S THUG
                         He missed!

               Batman SWERVES past the Joker's truck, SLALOMS, wrapping the 
               CABLES around a LAMP POST, SPINNING to a halt to watch...

         211   EXT. PARKSIDE -- CONTINUOUS                                  211   

               The cable goes TAUT, RIPPING one post from its foundation- 
               the TRUCK'S FRONT WHEELS CATCH, FLIPPING IT END OVER END...

               The Joker crawls from the wreckage.  He jumps over the median 
               and starts waving his pistol at oncoming traffic.  Batman 
               GUNS the bat-pod and rides it up and over the median.

         212   INT. ARMORED CAR -- NIGHT                                    212   

               The Driver slows the car, pulls to the side.

                                     SHOTGUN SWAT
                         What the hell are you doing?

         213   EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT                                       213   

               The Joker walks towards the Bat-pod, which SPEEDS towards 
               him.  He is FIRING his gun RANDOMLY at the oncoming traffic.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Hit me.  Come on.  Hit me.

               Batman watches as the Joker holds out his arms.  Waiting for 
               impact.  There is no room to go around him.

               Batman LOCKS UP THE BRAKES.

               The Joker watches as Batman DUMPS the bike, rather than

               Smashing into him.  Batman SLAMS into the wall.

               The Joker's thug reach Batman first.  He is unconscious.  
               The first Thug pulls at the mask.  An ELECTRIC SHOCK from 
               the batsuit THROWS him back.  The Joker LAUGHS.  Flicks his 
               switchblade.  Crouches-

                                     VOICE
                         Drop it.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Just give me a second.

               The gun is COCKED.  The Joker drops the knife.  Sits.  Looks 
               back.  Behind them is the armored car.  The man standing 
               over him is the Driver.  He pulls off his helmet.

               It's JIM GORDON.  Back from the dead.

               Dent looks up as the door swings open to reveal Gordon.  
               Dent GRINS.

                                     DENT
                         Lieutenant, you do like to play it 
                         pretty close to the chest...

                                     GORDON
                         We got him, Harvey.

               Dent nods.  Respect in his eyes.  They shake hands.

         215   EXT. PARKSIDE -- NIGHT                                       215   

               A small army of cops have sealed off the roadway.  Gordon 
               pulls away in the squad car containing the Joker.

               REPORTERS clamor for an interview with Dent, who is being 
               helped out of the van by the SWATS.  Ramirez pushes through 
               the pack, shoving reporters aside.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         Let him be!  He's been through enough-

               Dent follows Ramirez to a squad car- Wuertz is in the driver's 
               seat.  Dent smiles at Ramirez as she opens the rear door.

                                     DENT
                         Thanks, detective- I've got a date 
                         with a pretty upset fiancÈe.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         I figured, counselor.

               Ramirez shuts the door on Dent.  Signals Wuertz to pull out.

               The Joker sits in a holding cage.  His makeup has run, his 
               clothes a mess- but his calm lends him an odd dignity.  COPS 
               SMASH their night sticks against the bars near the Joker's 
               head.  The Joker does not flinch.

                                     GORDON
                         Stand away!  All of you.  I don't 
                         want anything for his mob lawyer to 
                         use, understand?  Handle this guy 
                         like he's made of glass.

               The Mayor walks in.  Shakes Gordon's hand.

                                     MAYOR
                         Back from the dead.

                                     GORDON
                         I couldn't chance my family's safety.

               The Mayor looks over at the Joker in his cage.

                                     MAYOR
                         What do we got?

                                     GORDON
                         Nothing.  No matches on prints, DNA, 
                         dental.  Clothing is custom, no 
                         labels.  Nothing in his pockets but 
                         knives and lint.  No name, no other 
                         alias... nothing.

                                     MAYOR
                         Go home, Gordon.  The clown'll keep 
                         till morning.  Get some rest- you're 
                         going to need it.  Tomorrow, you 
                         take the big job.
                              (off look)
                         You don't have any say in the matter.
                              (louder, for all)
                         Commissioner Gordon.

               The cops in M.C.U. start CHEERING.

         217   EXT. GORDON HOME -- NIGHT                                    217   

               Gordon rings the bell.  Barbara answers it, dressed in black.

                                     GORDON
                         Couldn't tell you.  I couldn't risk-

               She SLAPS Gordon.  He grabs her, holds her tight as she sobs.

         218   INT. HOLDING, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT                   218   

               The Joker's men are processed.  In the harsh light, the men 
               look a little ridiculous in their clown make-up.  DETECTIVE 
               MURPHY turns to Stephens.

                                     DETECTIVE MURPHY
                         Look at these ugly bastards.

               One of the men, walks over, clutching at his belly.

                                     FAT THUG
                         I don't feel good.

                                     DETECTIVE MURPHY
                         You're a cop killer.  You're lucky 
                         to be feeling anything below the 
                         neck.

               Alone in his cage, the Joker smiles at this.

         219   INT. KIDS' BEDROOM, GORDON HOME -- NIGHT                     219   

               Gordon crouches by his son's beside.  He reaches out to touch 
               James Jr's cheek.  James's eyes open.  Staring at his dad as 
               if still dreaming.

                                     JAMES
                              (whispers)
                         Did Batman save you, dad?

               Gordon looks at his son.  A little pride seeps in.

                                     GORDON
                         Actually, this time I saved him.

               Gordon's phone rings-

         220   INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT              220   

               Gordon PUSHES through the swarm of detectives crowded into 
               the observation room.  The Joker can be seen through the 
               glass, as well as on a large MONITOR.  Sitting there.  Calm.

                                     GORDON
                         Has he said anything, yet?

               Ramirez shakes her head.  Gordon PUSHES through a door...

         221   INT. INTERROGATION, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT             221   

               The Joker, in near darkness.  Gordon walks in.  Sits.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Evening, Commissioner.

                                     GORDON
                         Harvey Dent never made it home.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Of course not.

                                     GORDON
                         What have you done with him?

                                     THE JOKER
                              (laughs)
                         Me?  I was right here.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Who did you leave him with?  Your 
                         people?  Assuming, of course, that 
                         they are your people not Maroni's...
                              (off look)
                         Does it depress you, Lieutenant, to 
                         know how alone you are?

               Gordon can't help glancing at the mounted CAMERA.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Does it make you feel responsible 
                         for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

                                     GORDON
                         Where is he?

                                     THE JOKER
                         What time is it?

                                     GORDON
                         What difference does that make?

                                     THE JOKER
                         Depending on the time, he might be 
                         in one spot.
                              (smiles)
                         Or several.

               Gordon stands.  Moves to the Joker.  Undoes his handcuffs.

                                     GORDON
                         If we're going to play games, I'm 
                         going to need a cup of coffee.

                                     THE JOKER
                         The good cop, bad cop routine?

               Gordon pauses, hand on the doorknob.

                                     GORDON
                         Not exactly.

               Gordon steps out.  The overhead lights COME ON.  BATMAN IS 
               BEHIND HIM.  The Joker BLINKS in the HARSH WHITE LIGHT.

               WHAM!  The Joker's face HITS the table- comes up for air-

               CRACK!  CRACK!  To the head.  Batman is in front of him.  
               The Joker stares, fascinated.  Bleeding.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Never start with the head... victim 
                         gets fuzzy.  Can't feel the next-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        91.


               CRACK!  Batman's fist SMACKS down on the Joker's fingers.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                              (calm)
                         See?

                                     BATMAN
                         You wanted me.  Here I am.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I wanted to see what you'd do.  And 
                         you didn't disappoint...
                              (laughs)
                         You let five people die.  Then you 
                         let Dent take your place.  Even to a 
                         guy like me... that's cold-

                                     BATMAN
                         Where's Dent?

                                     THE JOKER
                         Those mob fools want you gone so 
                         they can get back to the way things 
                         were.  But I know the truth- there's 
                         no going back.  You've changed things.  
                         Forever.

                                     BATMAN
                         Then why do you want to kill me?

               The Joker starts LAUGHING.  After a moment he's laughing so 
               hard it sounds like SOBBING.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Kill you?  I don't want to kill you.  
                         What would I do without you?  Go 
                         back to ripping off Mob dealers?  No 
                         you...
                              (points)
                         You.  Complete.  Me.

                                     BATMAN
                         You're garbage who kills for money.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Don't talk like one of them- you're 
                         not, even if you'd like to be.  To 
                         them you're a freak like me... they 
                         just need you right now.

               He regards Batman with something approaching pity.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         But as soon as they don't, they'll 
                         cast you out like a leper.

               The Joker looks into Batman's eyes.  Searching.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Their morals, their code... it's a 
                         bad joke.  Dropped at the first sign 
                         of trouble.  They're only as good as 
                         the world allows them to be.  You'll 
                         see- I'll show you... when the chips 
                         are down, these civilized people... 
                         they'll eat each other.
                              (grins)
                         See, I'm not a monster... I'm just 
                         ahead of the curve.

               Batman GRABS the Joker and pulls him upright.

         222   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT          222   

               One of the Detectives moves for the door.  Gordon stops him.

                                     GORDON
                         He's in control.

         223   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT        223   

               Batman HOISTS the Joker up by the neck.

                                     BATMAN
                         Where's Dent?

                                     THE JOKER
                         You have these rules.  And you think 
                         they'll save you.

                                     BATMAN
                         I have one rule.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Then that's the one you'll have to 
                         break.  To know the truth.

                                     BATMAN
                         Which is?

                                     THE JOKER
                              (smiles)
                         The only sensible way to live in 
                         this world is without rules.  Tonight 
                         you're going to break your one rule...

               Batman leans in to the Joker.

                                     BATMAN
                         I'm considering it.

                         For a while I thought you really 
                         were Dent, the way you threw yourself 
                         after her-

               Batman DROPS the Joker- RIPS up a bolted-down chair-

         224   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT          224   

               Gordon MOVES for the door-

         225   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU -- CONTINUOUS                     225   

               Batman JAMS the chair under the doorknob- PICKS up the Joker 
               and HURLS him into the two-way glass.  The glass SPIDERS.

         226   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT        226   

               The Joker, bleeding from nose and mouth, LAUGHS at Batman.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Look at you go... does Harvey know 
                         about you and his-?

               The Joker SMASHES into the wall- SLIDES to the floor.  Batman 
               stands over him, a man possessed-

                                     BATMAN
                         WHERE ARE THEY?!

               He GRABS the Joker, holding him close-

                                     THE JOKER
                         Killing is making a choice...

               Batman PUNCHES the Joker across the face.  HARD.

                                     BATMAN
                         WHERE ARE THEY?!

               The Joker FEEDS off Batman's anger.  Loving it.

                                     THE JOKER
                         ...you choose one life over the other.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Your friend, the district attorney.  
                         Or his blushing bride-to-be.

               Batman PUNCHES the Joker again.  The Joker LAUGHS.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         You have nothing.  Nothing to threaten 
                         me with.  Nothing to do with all 
                         your strength...
                              (spits a tooth)
                         But don't worry, I'm going to tell 
                         you where they are.  Both of them, 
                         and that's the point- you'll have to 
                         choose.

               The Batman stares at the Joker...

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         He's at 250 52nd Boulevard.  And 
                         she's on avenue X at Cicero.

               Batman DROPS him.

         227   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT          227   

               Batman RACES past Gordon.

                                     GORDON
                         Which one are you-

                                     BATMAN
                         Dent knew the risks.

               Gordon looks back- the Joker is bloody, but grinning.

         228   EXT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT                            228   

               Several cops see Batman climb onto the bat-pod and TEAR off.

         231   INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT                             231   

               Black.

               Harvey Dent opens his eyes.  He's bound to a chair in a dingy, 
               unfurnished basement apartment.

                                     DENT
                         Rachel?  Rachel is that you?

                                     RACHEL
                              (sobbing)
                         Harvey.  You're OK.  I thought...

               Her voice is coming from a speakerphone on the floor.

                                     DENT
                         It's OK, Rachel.  Everything's going 
                         to be just fine.

               He looks around.  Behind him, metal BARRELS, hooked up to a 
               car battery, with a TIMER counting down: five minutes.

         232   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT        232   

               The Joker sits, smiling, content.  Stephens guards the door.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I want my phone call.

                         That's nice.

                                     THE JOKER
                         How many of your friends have I 
                         killed?

                                     STEPHENS
                         I'm a twenty year man.  I can tell 
                         the difference between punks who 
                         need a little lesson in manners, and 
                         the freaks like you who would just 
                         enjoy it.
                              (quiet)
                         And you killed six of my friends.

               The Fat Thug shuffles to the bars, where a COP stands guard.

                                     FAT THUG
                              (agony)
                         Please.  My insides hurt.

                                     COP
                         Step away from the bars.

                                     FAT THUG
                         The boss said he would make the voices 
                         go away.  He said he would go inside 
                         and replace them with bright lights.  
                         Like Christmas.

                                     COP
                         That's great.  Please step-

               The Fat Thug COLLAPSES.  The Cop grabs his radio.

         234   INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT                                      234   

               Rachel is bound to a chair.  Behind her are barrels identical 
               to the ones behind Dent.

                                     DENT
                         Can you move your chair?

                                     RACHEL
                         No.  Harvey, we don't have much time-

               The timer connected to the bomb reads 2.47... 2.46...

         235   INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT                             235   

               Dent DRAGS his chair, inching closer to the barrels.

                                     DENT
                         Look for something to free yourself.

               The chair JAMS against a ridge in the floor.  Dent STRAINS 
               to reach the timer.  Inches shy.

                                     RACHEL
                         They said only one of us was going 
                         to make it.  That they'd let our...
                              (pause)
                         Our friends choose...

               Dent strains... THE CHAIR, AND DENT, TOPPLE OVER- KNOCKING 
               OVER A BARREL.

                                     RACHEL (CONT'D)
                         Harvey?  What's happening?

               Dent, one side of his face pressed against the bare floor, 
               watches the open barrel SPEW DIESEL FUEL around him-

                                     DENT
                         Nothing.  I'm trying to...

               Dent contorts his head to keep from swallowing any.

               The bat-pod SKIDS SIDEWAYS, WHEELS FLIPPING as the gyro keeps 
               Batman upright on the tumbling bike- it comes to rest- guns 
               lined up with a fire exit- BLOWS the door off its hinges-
               JUMPS off the bike-

               Gridlock.  Gordon SWERVES onto the sidewalk.  People SCATTER.

         238   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT        238   

               The Joker sits like a kid kept after class.  He smiles.

                                     THE JOKER
                         You know why I use a knife, Detective?  
                         Guns are too quick.  You don't get 
                         to savor all the little emotions.  
                         See, in their last moments, people 
                         show you who they really are...

               Stephens tries hard to ignore him.  It isn't working.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         So, in a way, I knew your friends 
                         better than you ever did.
                              (smiles)
                         Would you like to know which of them 
                         were really cowards?

                                     STEPHENS
                              (rolls up sleeves)
                         I know you're going to enjoy this.  
                         But I'm going to enjoy it more.

               Stephens PUNCHES the Joker in the gut.

                         Harvey, in case... I want you to 
                         know something...

               Dent CHOKES, his emotions overwhelming him.

                                     DENT
                         Don't think like that, Rachel.  
                         They're coming for you.

                         I don't want to live without you.  
                         Because I do have an answer, and my

               A MEDIC CUTS away the Fat Thug's shirt- his belly has large 
               INCISION, which has been closed with crude looking STITCHES-

                                     MEDIC
                         He's got some kind of... contusion...

               A RECTANGULAR SHAPE is visible under the skin above his navel.

         242   INT. DETECTIVE'S ROOM, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT          242   

               Stephens shuffles out into the room, a piece of BROKEN GLASS 
               held to his THROAT by the Joker.  Cops draw their weapons.

                                     STEPHENS
                         This is my own damn fault.  Just 
                         shoot him.

                         I want my phone call.

               The Detectives look at each other.  One of them pulls out 
               his cell phone.  TOSSES it to the Joker, who begins to dial.

         243   INT. HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT              243   

               The Medic gingerly PRESSES the rectangle.  It illuminates, a 
               soft blue light visible through the skin.

                                     COP

               The Joker presses SEND.  At the end of the room, the door to 
               the holding area EXPLODES-

         247   INT. HALLWAY, TENEMENT -- NIGHT                              247   

               Batman KICKS- the door gives- Batman SMASHES it open-

         248   INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT                             248   

               Batman BURSTS through the door- Dent looks up in horror-

                                     DENT
                         NO!  Not me... Why did you come for 
                         me?!

               Batman STARES at Dent.  The Joker lied.  The counter hits 5

               Seconds.  Batman DRAGS Dent out- Dent FIGHTS to stay-

                                     DENT (CONT'D)

               Gordon, axe in hand, RUNS towards the entrance-

               Rachel can hear Dent.  The counter runs out.

                                     RACHEL
                              (calm)
                         Somewhere-

               AN EXPLOSION.  ALL-CONSUMING.

         251   EXT. 52ND STREET, GOTHAM -- NIGHT                            251   

               The BLAST HURLS Gordon backward onto the hood of his car- 
               THE ENTIRE WAREHOUSE IS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION-

         252   INT. BASEMENT APARTMENT -- NIGHT                             252   

               Batman wraps his cape around Dent and hurls them both through 
               the door.  Dent is SCREAMING-

               Gordon picks himself up.  The warehouse is an inferno.  He 
               heads for it anyway.  Five of his men have to RESTRAIN HIM.

         254   EXT. ALLEYWAY, GOTHAM -- NIGHT                               254   

               A SECOND EXPLOSION- Batman COVERS Dent as the FIREBALL HITS 
               them- IGNITING the diesel soaking Dent's left side- he starts 
               BURNING.  And stops screaming.  Batman ROLLS Dent on the wet 
               pavement... Dent SIZZLES.  Silent.

         255   INT. SPECIAL HOLDING AREA, MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- NIGHT      255   

               The Joker walks to the bars of another cell.  Grins.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Hello there.

               In his cell.  Terrified.  Lau.

         256   EXT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS                                 256   

               Dent is wheeled into an ambulance, bandages held to his face.

               His one visible eye STARES BLANKLY, oblivious to the panic-

         257   EXT. 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS                               257   

               Gordon watches the fire.  DEBRIS blows across the asphalt.

               Gordon picks up two pieces: SINGED JOKER CARDS.  In place of 
               the Joker's face is a PHOTO OF LAU.  A POLICE SERGEANT 
               approaches.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Dent's alive, Jim.  Just.  But back 
                         at M.C.U.... the Joker's gone...

                                     GORDON
                         With Lau?
                              (the Cop nods)
                         The Joker planned to be caught.  He 
                         wanted me to lock him up in M.C.U..

         258   EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM -- DAWN                         258   

               A squad car BLAZES down the street.  The Joker sticks his 
               head out the window like a dog, feeling the wind...

         259   INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN                        259   

               Alfred sits at a table reading the letter from Rachel.

               Water.  Smoldering blackness.  The FIRE CREWS extinguish the 
               last flames of the devastated building.  A FIREMAN nudges 
               his COLLEAGUE, pointing out something in the devastation...

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         ...I need to be honest and clear. 
                         I'm going to marry Harvey Dent...

               Glimpses of Dent's damaged face as SURGEONS surround him.

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         I love him, I want to spend the rest

               The Firemen watch a statue-like figure amidst the charred 
               ruins.  The Batman.

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         When I told you that if Gotham no 
                         longer needed Batman we could be 
                         together, I meant it...

         263   INT. MCU, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- DAY                              263   

               Gordon surveys the wreckage of MCU.  The bodies.

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         But I'm not sure the day will come...

               Batman bends to the ground on one knee, his black glove spread 
               against the smoldering debris.

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         ...when you no longer need Batman.  
                         I hope it does, and if it does I 
                         will be there...

               He spots something.  DENT'S TWO-HEADED COIN.  Blackened, 
               SCARRED.  Batman turns it over.  The other side is PRISTINE.

         265   INT. KITCHEN, WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN                        265

               Dent, heavily bandaged, hooked up to various machines.

               Batman stands at the foot of his bed.  Watching.

                                     RACHEL (V.O.)
                         If you lose your faith in me, please

                         I'm sorry, Harvey.

               Batman puts DENT'S DAMAGED COIN on the bedside table.

                         Love, now and always, Rachel.

               Alfred finishes the letter.  Tears in his eyes, he folds it 
               back into its envelope.  Places it on the breakfast tray.

         268   INT. WAYNE PENTHOUSE -- DAWN                                 268   

               Alfred moves through the silent space, stepping past the 
               cowl and gauntlets lying on the cold marble.  He approaches 
               Wayne, half-undressed, slumped in a chair, watching Gotham.

                                     ALFRED
                         I prepared a little breakfast.

               Nothing.  Alfred sets down the tray.  The envelope is propped 
               against the silver teapot.

                                     ALFRED (CONT'D)

                         Yes, Master Wayne?

               Wayne turns, a desperate look in his eye.

                                     WAYNE
                         Did I bring this on us?  On her?  I

                         didn't you think there might be 
                         casualties?  Things were always going 
                         to have to get worse before they got 
                         better.

                         for.  What we stand for.

               Wayne looks up at Alfred.  Alfred picks up the cowl.

                                     ALFRED (CONT'D)

               Alfred hands him the cowl.  Wayne looks at him.

                                     WAYNE
                         She was going to wait for me.  Dent

               Alfred glances at the envelope.  Takes it off the tray.

               Dent.  Bandaged.  Sedated.  Coming up for air.  Sees something 
               on the table: his coin.  He fumbles for it, marvelling at 
               its shiny face.  Remembering.

               INSERT CUT: RACHEL CATCHES THE COIN.

               Dent turns the coin over.  The other side is devastated.  He 
               STARES at the scarred face.  Starts ripping his bandages.

                         pain but you won't accept medication.  
                         That you're refusing skin grafts-

                                     DENT
                         Remember the name you all had for me 
                         when I was at Internal Affairs?  
                         What was it, Gordon?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       105.


                                     GORDON
                         Harvey, I can't-

                                     DENT
                         SAY IT!

               Dent's anger makes Gordon flinch.  He looks away.  Ashamed.

                                     GORDON
                              (small)
                         Two-face.  Harvey two-face.

               Dent turns to face Gordon- the left side of Dent's face is 
               DESTROYED- skin blackened and shriveled.  Molars visible.  
               The eye a ball and socket.  Dent manages a small smile with 
               the good side of his face.

                                     DENT
                         Why should I hide who I am?

                                     GORDON
                         I... I know you tried to warn me.  
                         I'm sorry.  Wuertz picked you up- 
                         was he working for them?
                              (nothing)
                         Do you know who picked up Rachel?
                              (nothing)
                         Harvey, I need to know which of my 
                         men I can trust.

               Dent looks at Gordon.  Cold.

                                     DENT
                         Why would you listen to me now?

                                     GORDON
                         I'm sorry, Harvey.

                                     DENT
                         No.  No you're not.  Not yet.

               Gordon takes a last look at Dent.  Then leaves.

         273   INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                        273   

               Gordon steps out.  Someone is there.  Maroni.  On crutches.

               Gordon stares at him.  Cold.  Maroni shifts, awkward.

                                     MARONI
                         This craziness.  This is too much.

                                     GORDON
                         You should have thought of that before 
                         you let the clown out of the box.

                                     MARONI
                         You want him, I can tell you where 
                         he'll be this afternoon.

               The Chechen gets out of his SUV.  Looks at a RUSTED HULK.

               The Chechen, bodyguards, and dogs, head up the gangplank.

         275   INT. RUSTED HULK -- CONTINUOUS                               275   

               They pass into a huge hold.  In the middle: A BILLION DOLLARS.  
               The pile is thirty feet high.  Standing on top- the Joker.  
               At his feet, bound, is Lau.  The Chechen laughs.

                                     CHECHEN
                         Like I say- not so crazy as you look.

               The Joker jumps from the top, slides down the pile.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I told you- I'm a man of my word.
                              (looks around)
                         Where's the Italian?

               The Chechen shrugs.  Pulls out a cigar.  Lights it.

                                     CHECHEN
                         More for us.  What you do with all 
                         your money, Mr. Joker?

               The Joker GRABS a can of GASOLINE from his thug.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I'm a man of simple tastes.  I like 
                         gunpowder.  Dynamite...

               He is SPLASHING gasoline onto the money.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         ...gasoline...

               The Chechen, FURIOUS, steps forwards.  The Joker turns.  
               JABS his gun in the Chechen's face.  The Chechen's bodyguards 
               REACT.  The Joker's men DRAW on them.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         And you know what they have in common?  
                         They're cheap.

                                     CHECHEN
                         You said you were a man of your word.

               The Joker PLUCKS the cigar from the Chechen's lips.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I am.

               The Joker tosses the cigar at the pile.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         I'm only burning my half.

               The Chechen watches the money catch fire.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         All you care about is money.  This 
                         city deserves a better class of 
                         criminal, and I'm going to give it 
                         to them.  This is my town now.  Tell 
                         your men they work for me.

               The Joker crouches down to the Chechen's dogs.  They GROWL.

                                     CHECHEN
                         They won't work for a freak.

               The Joker takes out a knife.  Tosses it to his man.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Cut him up and offer him to his little 
                         Princes.  Let's show him just how 
                         loyal a hungry dog is.

               The Joker's men GRAB the Chechen.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         It's not about money.  It's about 
                         sending a message...

               The Joker watches the towering FLAMES.  Lau screams.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         Everything.  Burns.

               The Joker pulls out a phone...

         276   INT. TELEVISION STUDIO -- DAY                                276   

               Reese has a confident air.  Engel is taking calls.

                                     CALLER 1 (O.S.)
                         I wanna how much they're gonna pay 
                         you to say who Batman really is.

                                     REESE
                         That's simply not why I'm doing this.

                                     ENGEL
                         Caller, you're on the air.

                                     CALLER 2 (O.S.)
                         Harvey Dent didn't want us to give 
                         in to this maniac- you think you 
                         know better than him?  

                                     ENGEL
                         Guy's got a point- Dent didn't want 
                         Batman to give himself up, is this 
                         the right thing to do?

                                     REESE
                         If we could talk to Dent now he might 
                         feel differently-

                                     ENGEL
                         And we wish him a speedy recovery.  
                         God knows we need him, now.  Let's 
                         take another call-

                                     OLD LADY (O.S.)
                         Mr. Reese, what's more valuable: one 
                         life, or a hundred?  

                                     REESE
                         I guess it would depend on the life.

                                     OLD LADY (O.S.)
                         OK.  Let's say it's _your_ life.  Is 
                         it worth more than the lives of 
                         several hundred others?  

                                     REESE
                         Of course not.

                                     OLD LADY (O.S.)
                         I'm glad you feel that way.  Because 
                         I've put a bomb in one of the city's 
                         hospitals.  It's going off in sixty 
                         minutes unless someone kills you.

                                     ENGEL
                         Who is this?

                                     OLD LADY (O.S.)
                         Just a concerned citizen-
                              (drops pitch to the 
                              JOKER'S VOICE)

         277   INT. MAJOR CRIMES UNIT, GOTHAM CENTRAL -- CONTINUOUS         277   

               Gordon and his men are gearing up to take down the Joker.  A 
               Detective turns up the TV in the bullpen-

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       109.


                                     THE JOKER (O.S.)
                         I had a vision.  Of a world without 
                         Batman.  The mob ground out a little 
                         profit and the police tried to shut 
                         them down, one block at a time... 
                         and it was so... boring.  I've had a 
                         change of heart.  I don't want Mr. 
                         Reese spoiling everything, but why 
                         should I have all the fun?  Let's 
                         give someone else a chance...

               Reese looks around, twitching.  Sweating.

                                     THE JOKER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                         If Coleman Reese isn't dead in sixty 
                         minutes, then I blow up a hospital.  
                         Of course, you could always kill 
                         yourself, Mr. Reese.  But that would 
                         be the noble thing to do.  And you're 
                         a lawyer.

               The line rings off.  Engel is speechless.

               Gordon turns to the uniform COPS.

                                     GORDON
                         Call in every officer- tell them to 
                         head to their nearest hospital and 
                         start evac and search.  Call the 
                         transit authority, school board, 
                         prisons- get every available bus 
                         down to a hospital- the priority is 
                         Gotham General- wheel everybody out 
                         of that place right now- my hunch is 
                         that's where the bomb is.

                         Why?

                                     GORDON
                         That's where Harvey Dent is.

               The Uniforms SPRINT off.  Gordon turns to his Detectives.

                                     UNIFORMED COP
                         Where are we going, sir?

               On screen: Reese is a deer in the headlights.

                                     GORDON
                         To get Reese.

               Gordon and his men escort Reese out of the elevator- Engel 
               follows with a camera crew.  As they approach the glass doors 
               Gordon looks out at an angry crowd.

                                     ENGEL

               Gordon SPOTS an OLD MAN raising a PISTOL- Gordon THROWS Reese 
               to the ground as SHOTS SHATTER the laminated glass of the

                         Well, maybe Batman will save you.

               The van PEELS out.  Heads onto the streets.

               Cops load patients onto BUSES.  A TV van pulls up, Engel and 
               his Cameraman jump out.  One of Dent's guards, POLK, looks 
               into a SCHOOL BUS.  Turns to the Cop loading it.

                                     POLK

               Polk enters the room.  No Davis.  Just a REDHEADED NURSE, 
               back towards him, reading Dent's chart.

                                     POLK

               Gordon is reading his phone: ERIKSON, BERG.  Gordon looks up 
               sharply.  Considers the uniformed cop nervously fingering 
               his shotgun.

                                     GORDON
                         Berg, isn't it?

               The young cop, BERG, looks up.  Sweating.

               The Joker draws closer to Dent's bed.  Dent STRAINS at the 
               leather cuffs binding him to the bed.

                                     THE JOKER
                         I don't want there to be any hard 
                         feelings between us, Harvey.

               The Joker loosens Dent's restraints.

                         When you and Rachel were being

                         cage.  I didn't rig those charges-

                         Do I really look like a guy with a 
                         plan, Harvey?  I don't have a 
                         plan...The mob has plans, the cops 
                         have plans.  You know what I am,

               Dent's hand is TREMBLING.

                         I'm a dog chasing cars... I wouldn't 
                         know what to do with one if I caught 
                         it.  I just do things.  I'm just the 
                         wrench in the gears.  I hate plans.  
                         Yours, theirs, everyone's.  Maroni 
                         has plans.  Gordon has plans.  
                         Schemers trying to control their 
                         worlds.  I'm not a schemer, I show 
                         the schemers how pathetic their 
                         attempts to control things really 
                         are.  So when I say that you and 
                         your girlfriend was nothing personal, 
                         you know I'm telling the truth...

               Hands him the pistol.  Dent holds it to the Joker's head.

               Wayne ROARS past a line of traffic to settle in a few cars 
               back from the police van, sitting at a red light.

               Gordon watches Berg, mentally tracing the trajectory of his 
               shotgun barrel as Berg fiddles with his gun.  Gordon starts 
               trying to subtly unholster his own weapon.

                                     GORDON
                         I'm gonna need your weapon, son.

               Berg looks at Gordon.

                                     BERG
                         What?

               the police van.  Lining it up.

               Reese looks from Berg to Gordon.  Berg looks at Gordon, 
               trembling, the barrel of his gun inching lower in the car.

                                     BERG
                         Why?  Because my wife's in hospital?

                                     GORDON
                         Yeah.  That would be why.

               The Joker leans in, pressing his head to the gun's barrel.

                                     THE JOKER
                         It's the schemers who put you where 
                         you are.  You were a schemer.  You 
                         had plans.  Look where it got you.  
                         I just did what I do best- I took 
                         your plan, and I turned it on itself.  
                         Look what I've done to this city 
                         with a few drums of gas and a couple 
                         of bullets.  Nobody panics when the 
                         expected people get killed.  Nobody 
                         panics when things go according to 
                         plan, even if the plan is horrifying.
                         If I tell the press that tomorrow a 
                         gangbanger will get shot, or a 
                         truckload of soldiers will be blown 
                         up, nobody panics.  Because it's all 
                         part of the plan.  But when I say 
                         that one little old mayor will die, 
                         everybody loses their minds!

                         Introduce a little anarchy, you upset 
                         the established order and everything 
                         becomes chaos.  I'm an agent of chaos.  
                         And you know the thing about chaos, 
                         Harvey?

               Dent looks into the Joker's eyes.  Finding meaning.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         It's fair.

               Dent looks down at the coin in his hands.  Turns it over, 
               feels it's comforting weight.  Shows the Joker the good side.

                                     DENT
                         You live.

               He turns the coin over.  The flip side is deeply SCARRED.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         You die.

               The Joker looks at the coin.  Looks at Dent, admiringly.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Now you're talking.

               Dent FLICKS the coin into the air.  Catches it.  Looks.

               Wayne's Lamborghini SLIPS alongside the van- the pickup

               SMASHES INTO THE LAMBORGHINI

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       116.


         303   INT. POLICE VAN -- CONTINUOUS                                303   

               As the van JOLTS with the impact Gordon LEAPS forward, PUSHING 
               UP Berg's shotgun barrel, which FIRES into the roof- Gordon 
               SMASHES Berg on the head with his sidearm.

         304   EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS              304   

               Gordon's men pull the pickup driver from his cab- Gordon 
               crouches down to the Lamborghini wreck to help pull Wayne 
               from the car.  Gordon recognizes him as he pulls him free.

                                     GORDON
                         You okay, Mr. Wayne?

               Wayne looks at him, woozy.  Sits on the curb.

                                     WAYNE
                         Call me Bruce.  I think so.

                                     GORDON
                         That was a brave thing, you did.

                                     WAYNE
                         Trying to catch the light?

                                     GORDON
                         You weren't protecting the van?

               Wayne turns- sees the police van as if for the first time.

               Reese steps down, dazed.

                                     WAYNE
                         Why?  Who's in it?

               Reese locks eyes with Wayne.  Nods.  Gordon sizes up Bruce 
               Wayne and his crushed sports car.

                                     GORDON
                         You don't watch a whole lot of news, 
                         do you, Mr. Wayne?

                                     WAYNE
                              (shrugs)
                         It can get a little intense.  Think 
                         I should go to hospital?

                                     GORDON
                         Not today, I wouldn't.

         305   INT. CORRIDOR, HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                        305   

               The Joker walks calmly through the mostly deserted building.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       117.


               As he walks he pulls a DETONATOR from his pocket.  Strolling 
               along he PUSHES THE BUTTON... STAGGERED EXPLOSIONS BURST 
               INTO THE CORRIDOR BEHIND HIM LIKE DEMOLITION BLASTS... the 
               Joker just walks out the door...

         306   EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                                  306   

               The Joker STROLLS down the steps- WINDOWS BLOW OUT IN SERIES- 
               People DIVE for cover- Engel PILES into a school bus-

               The Joker walks across the parking lot- THE BUILDING 
               COLLAPSING BEHIND HIM...

         307   EXT. INTERSECTION, GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS              307   

               Gordon hears the EXPLOSION.

                                     GORDON
                         Gotham general...
                              (grabs his phone)
                         Did you get Dent out?

                                     COP (O.S.)
                         I think so-

         308   EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                                  308   

               The Cop cowers as DEBRIS and SMOKE BLAST across the street-

         309   INT. SCHOOL BUS -- CONTINUOUS                                309   

               The Joker gets onto the bus.  Nods at his man at the wheel.

         310   EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                                  310   

               All eyes are on the collapsed building.  One school bus pulls 
               out from the line of other buses.  Heads down the street.

         311   INT. BAR, GOTHAM HEIGHTS -- DAY                              311   

               An empty neighborhood dive, the local DRUNK passed out at 
               the bar, BARTENDER, watching BREAKING NEWS on the TV.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Sweet Jesus.  D'you see this, Mike?  
                         They blew up a hospital...

               Detective Wuertz, at a booth looks up at the TV, bored.

                                     BARTENDER (CONT'D)
                         Shouldn't you be out there, you know, 
                         doing something?

                                     WUERTZ
                         It's my day off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       118.


               The Bartender shuts the register.

                                     BARTENDER
                         I gotta take a leak, keep an eye on 
                         things, will ya?

               The Bartender steps out.  The back door OPENS again.

                                     WUERTZ
                         What?  You need me to shake it for-

               He TRAILS off as someone sticks a gun in his face: Harvey 
               Dent.  Standing in shadow.  He sits.

                                     DENT
                         Hello.

                                     WUERTZ
                         Dent, I thought you was...dead...

               Dent leans into the light.  The left side of his face is 
               HIDEOUSLY BURNED, cheek gone, blackened teeth and gums.

                                     DENT
                         Half.

               Dent picks up Wuertz's drink.  Takes a SIP.  Wuertz watches 
               the bare muscles RETRACT as Dent SWALLOWS.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

                                     WUERTZ
                         It must've been Maroni's men-

               Dent SLAMS the glass back on the table- Wuertz FLINCHES.

                                     DENT
                         You, of all people, are gonna protect 
                         the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

                                     WUERTZ
                         I don't know- he'd never tell me.
                              (stares at Dent)
                         I swear to God, I didn't know what 
                         they were gonna do to you-

                                     DENT
                         Funny, I don't know what's going to 
                         happen to you, either.

               Dent pulls his coin from his pocket.  FLIPS it.  Wuertz 
               watches it SPIN.  It lands on the table.  Scarred side up.

               The drunk at the bar STIRS at the GUNSHOT.

         312   EXT. GOTHAM GENERAL -- DAY                                   312   

               Gordon, manic, surveys the scene with a Cop-

                                     GORDON
                         You must know how many were inside-
                         you've got patient lists, roll calls-

                                     COP
                         Sir!  Sir.  Take a look at what we're 
                         dealing with.  Cops, National Guard-
                              (gestures at buses)
                         We're showing 50 missing- but that 
                         building was clear.  These buses are 
                         heading off to other hospitals- my 
                         guess is we missed one.

                                     GORDON
                         Yeah?  What's your guess about where 
                         Harvey Dent is?

               The cop says nothing.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Keep looking.  Keep it to yourself.

         313   INT. FOX'S OFFICE WAYNE INDUSTRIES -- DAY                    313   

               Fox is watching the news.  His intercom buzzes.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Fox?  Security is showing a break-
                         in at the R and D department.

         314   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY        314   

               Fox watches two security men force the door.  He enters alone.

         315   INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- DAY                    315   

               Fox enters the dimly-lit room.  At one end is an extraordinary 
               array of thousands of tiny monitors.  Fox approaches, 
               fascinated, as they quietly display architectural patterns 
               individually and in concert.  The images become a MAP.

                                     BATMAN
                         Beautiful.  Isn't it?

               Fox nods, staring at the monitors as Batman approaches.

                                     FOX
                         Beautiful.  Unethical.  Dangerous.  
                         You've turned every phone in the 
                         city into a microphone...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       120.


               Lucius presses a key.  The BABBLE of a MILLION CONVERSATIONS 
               at once fills the room.  Every cell phone in the city.

                                     BATMAN
                         And high frequency generatorreceiver.

                                     FOX
                         Like the phone I gave you in Hong 
                         Kong.  You took my sonar concept and 
                         applied it to everybody's phone in 
                         the City.  With half the city feeding 
                         you sonar you can image all of Gotham.
                              (turns to Batman)
                         This is wrong.

                                     BATMAN
                         I've got to find this man, Lucius.

                                     FOX
                         But at what cost?

                                     BATMAN
                         The database is null-key encrypted.  
                         It can only be accessed by one person.

                                     FOX
                         No one should have that kind of power.

                                     WAYNE
                         That's why I gave it to you.  Only 
                         you can use it.

               Lucius looks at Batman.  Hard.

                                     FOX
                         Spying on thirty million people wasn't 
                         in my job description.

               Batman points to a TV screen.  Fox turns.  ON SCREEN: the 
               Joker shakes his head above a graphic "LATEST THREAT"...

                                     THE JOKER
                         What does it take to make you people 
                         want to join in..?  

         316   EXT. SITUATION TENT AT GOTHAM GENERAL -- CONTINUOUS          316   

               Gordon watches a screen.  Grave.

                                     THE JOKER
                         You failed to kill the lawyer... 
                         I've got to get you off the bench 
                         and into the game.  So, here it is...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       121.


         317   INT. BAR, DOWNTOWN -- CONTINUOUS                             317   

               The bar, packed with business people watches the TV.  SILENT.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Come nightfall, this city is mine, 
                         and anyone left here plays by my 
                         rules.  If you don't want to be in 
                         the game, get out now.

               Bar patrons start moving... The Joker reaches for the camera-

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd are 
                         in for a surprise.

               CUT TO STATIC.  The bar patrons look around, confused.

         318   INT. LAB, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT -- CONTINUOUS             318   

               Fox turns from the TV to look at Batman.

                                     BATMAN
                         Trust me.

               Fox stares at Batman.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         This is the audio sample.

               He plugs a USB dongle into the console.  A sample of the 
               Joker's voice from the call-in news program plays.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         If he talks within range of any phone 
                         in the city, you'll be able to 
                         triangulate his position.

               Lucius toggles a menu.  The city is an open book- People 
               working, eating, sleeping.  Lucius shakes his head.

                         When you've finished, type your name 
                         to switch it off.

                         I'll help you this one time...

               Lucius sits at the console.  Batman moves off-

                                     FOX (CONT'D)
                         But consider this my resignation.

               Batman turns.  Fox looks at him, serious.

         319   EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DUSK                               319   

               Gothamites POUR out of the city, on foot and by car... the 
               BRIDGES and TUNNELS are deserted, but for BOMB SQUAD search 
               teams.

         320   INT. CITY HALL -- CONTINUOUS                                 320   

               Gordon briefs the Mayor.

                                     GORDON
                         My officers are going over every 
                         inch of the tunnels and bridges, but 
                         with the Joker's threat they're not 
                         and option.

                                     MAYOR
                         Land routes East?

                                     GORDON
                         Backed up for hours.  Which leaves 
                         the ferries with thirty thousand 
                         waiting to board.  Plus, corrections 
                         are at capacity, so I want to use a 
                         ferry to take some prisoners off the 
                         island.

                                     MAYOR
                         The men you and Dent put away?  Those 
                         aren't people I'm worried about.

                                     GORDON
                         You should be- they're the people 
                         you least want to be stuck with in 
                         an emergency.  Whatever the Joker's 
                         planning, it's a good bet that 
                         Harvey's prisoners might be involved.  
                         I want 'em out of here.

         321   EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK                                  321   

               At the ferry terminal, National Guardsman watch over the 
               THIRTY THOUSAND jostling, scared people waiting to board the 
               two MASSIVE FERRIES to Seven Sisters.  Grumbles turn to YELLS 
               as 800 PRISONERS are loaded onto a ferry by shotgun-toting 
               CORRECTIONS OFFICERS.

                                     CIVILIAN
                         That ain't right!  We should be on 
                         that boat.

                                     NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                         You want to ride across with them, 
                         be my guest.

         322   EXT. BROWNSTONE -- DUSK                                      322   

               Maroni climbs into the back of a limo.

         323   INT. LIMO -- DUSK                                            323   

               Maroni settles back into his seat.  The car pulls away.

                                     MARONI
                         Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

                                     DENT
                         Going to join your wife?

               Maroni STARTS.  Someone is in here with him.  Harvey Dent-

               Two Face- leans forward, clutching a pistol.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         You love her?

                                     MARONI
                         Yes.

                                     DENT
                         Can you imagine what it would be 
                         like to listen to her die?

                                     MARONI
                         Take it up with the Joker.  He killed 
                         your woman.  Made you... like this...

                                     DENT
                         The Joker's just a mad dog.  I want 
                         whoever let him off the leash.

               Maroni looks at Dent.  Worried.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         I took care of Wuertz, but who was 
                         your other man inside Gordon's unit?
                         Who picked up Rachel?  It must've 
                         been someone she trusted.

                                     MARONI
                         If I tell you, will you let me go?

                                     DENT
                         It can't hurt your chances.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       124.


                                     MARONI
                         It was Ramirez.

               Pulls out his coin.  Dent cocks the pistol...

                                     MARONI (CONT'D)
                         But you said-

                                     DENT
                         I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

               Dent FLIPS it.  Looks: good side.  He shrugs.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Lucky guy.

               Maroni looks confused.  Dent FLIPS the coin again.  Looks 
               down at the coin.  Shakes his head.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         But he's not.

                                     MARONI
                         Who?

               Dent smiles.  PUTS HIS SEAT BELT ON.

                                     DENT
                         Your driver.

               Dent presses the barrel of the revolver behind the shadow of 
               the driver.  Maroni LUNGES, SCREAMING.  Dent FIRES.

         324   EXT. BRIDGE -- DUSK                                          324   

               The Limo SWERVES off of the bridge, SOARS out over the canal, 
               and PANCAKES into the RETAINING WALL.

         325   EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- DUSK                                  325   

               CIVILIANS CRAM their way onto one ferry.  Finally, the 
               COMMANDER of the National Guard unit SIGNALS to his men to 
               STOP BOARDING and CAST OFF.

               The two FERRIES set off across the river, heading for the 
               lights of the distant shore of the mainland.

         326   INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT                         326   

               The FIRST MATE looks out the window, at the second ferry.  
               It is DEAD in the WATER.  He turns to the PILOT [PRISON 
               FERRY].

                                     FIRST MATE
                         They've lost their engines.

                                     PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
                         Get on the radio and tell 'em we'll 
                         come back for them once we dump these
                         Scumbags-

               Suddenly, the control panel FLICKERS and DIES.

                                     PILOT [PRISON FERRY] (CONT'D)
                         Get down to the engine room.

         327   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT               327   

               The First Mate skirts around the PRISONERS and CORRECTIONS 
               OFFICERS...

         328   INT. ACCESS CORRIDOR, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT                328   

               The First Mate opens the door to the engine room.  STOPS.

               HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DIESEL FUEL.  And a small, wrapped 
               PRESENT, topped with a BOW.

         329   INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT                         329   

               The Pilot [Prison Ferry] is holding the small present.  His 
               radio CRACKLES.

                                     PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY] (O.S.)
                         Same thing over here- enough diesel 
                         to blow us sky high.  And a present.

         330   EXT. ELEVATED ROADWAY, DOWTOWN GOTHAM -- CONTINUOUS          330   

               Batman sits on the bat-pod, cape blowing.  Listening.

                                     BATMAN
                         Fox?  There's something going on on 
                         the ferries...

         331   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT               331   

               As cold scared Families watch, the NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER 
               UNWRAPS that ferry's present.  Inside, he finds a crude REMOTE 
               DETONATOR.

                                     NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
                         Why would they give us the detonator 
                         to our own bomb?

               Up in the wiring at the ceiling, a CELL PHONE taped in to 
               the P.A. rings and answers.

                                     THE JOKER (O.S.)

               ON BOTH FERRIES: CIVILIANS, PRISONERS, CREW, AND NATIONAL 
               GUARDSMEN ALL LISTEN AS THE JOKER'S VOICE RINGS OUT.

         332   INT. LAB, WAYNE ENTERPRISES -- NIGHT                         332   

               Lucius Fox looks up as the console CHIMES.

                                     FOX
                         I'm zeroing in.

                         now to blow you all sky high.  Anyone

                         His voice is on the ferry, but that's 
                         not the source...

         333   EXT. ROOFTOPS ABOVE GOTHAM -- NIGHT                          333   

               Batman looks out, across the entire city skyline.

                                     BATMAN
                         Do you have a location on the Joker?

                         It's west...

               Batman FIRES UP the bat-pod- his cape SHRINKS into its pack 
               form as he PEELS OUT, ROARING into the night.

                         But we're going to make things a 
                         little more interesting than that. 
                         Tonight, we're going to learn a little 
                         bit about ourselves...

         334   INT. GORDON HOME -- CONTINUOUS                               334   

               Barbara Gordon answers the phone.

                         Hi, Anna-

                         Listen carefully, there's no time.

                         Barbara, those cops can't be trusted.
                         Jim needs you away from them as soon 
                         as possible.  I'll call them off for
                         10 minutes, you'll have to move fast-

                         But where-

                                     RAMIREZ (O.S.)
                         I'm going to give you an address- 
                         Jim will meet you there...

         335   EXT. MCU -- CONTINUOUS                                       335   

               Ramirez is holding the phone.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         250, 52nd street.  Leave as soon as 
                         the patrol car pulls out.

               Dent is holding a gun at Ramirez's head.  She hangs up.

                                     DENT
                         She believe you?

               Ramirez nods.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         She trusts you.  Just like Rachel 
                         did.

                                     RAMIREZ
                         I didn't know-

                                     DENT
                         'What they were gonna do'?  You're 
                         the second cop to say that to me.  
                         What, exactly, did you think they 
                         were going to do?

                                     RAMIREZ
                         I'm sorry- they got me early on.  My 
                         mother's medical bills and my-

                                     DENT
                         Don't!

               Dent FLIPS his coin.

                                                                       128.


                                     RAMIREZ
                         I took a little from them- once 
                         they've got you, they keep you.  I'm 
                         sorry.

               Dent looks at his coin.  Good side.

                                     DENT
                         Live to fight another day, officer.

               Dent CRACKS her on the head with his gun.

         336   INT. BRIDGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT                         336   

               The Pilot [Prison Ferry] tries the radio.  It's DEAD.

                                     PILOT [PRISON FERRY]
                         He killed the radio.

                                     THE JOKER (O.S.)
                         There's no need for all of you to 
                         die.  That would be a waste.  So 
                         I've left you both a little present.

         337   EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT                    337   

               The Joker stares out over the harbor, at the ferries.  Talking 
               into a cell phone.  Holding a detonator, with TWO BUTTONS.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Each of you has a remote to blow up 
                         the other boat.

         338   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT               338   

               The Prisoners and Corrections Officers listen.  Appalled.

                                     THE JOKER (O.S.)
                         At midnight, I blow you all up.  If, 
                         however, one of you presses the 
                         button, I'll let that boat live.  
                         You
                         Choose.  So who's it going to be-
                         Harvey Dent's most wanted scumbag 
                         collection... or the sweet innocent 
                         civilians?  
                              (beat)
                         Oh, and you might want to decide 
                         quickly, because the people on the 
                         other boat may not be quite so noble.

               The Joker HANGS UP.  The Pilot [Prisoner Ferry] looks down 
               at the remote in his hands.  Prisoners begin YELLING and 
               PUSHING.  The WARDEN takes the remote from the Pilot- COCKS 
               his shotgun.  His men level their weapons at the crowd.

         339   EXT. FERRY TERMINAL -- CONTINUOUS                            339   

               Gordon looks out at the ferries.  His phone rings.

                                     BATMAN
                         Have the Joker's location-

         340   EXT. GOTHAM STREETS -- CONTINUOUS                            340   

               Batman ROARS along on the bat-pod.

                                     BATMAN
                         Prewitt building.  Assemble on the 
                         building opposite.

         341   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT               341   

               The National Guard Commander is holding the remote.  Several 
               passengers take a step towards him.  He PULLS his weapon.

                                     NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
                         Stay back.

               A BUSINESSMAN clutching his briefcase speaks up.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         Who are you to decide?  We ought to 
                         talk it over, at least.

               Other passengers agree.  A MOTHER with two KIDS speaks up.

                                     MOTHER
                         We don't all have to die.  Why should 
                         my babies die?  Those men had their 
                         chance-

                                     NATIONAL GUARD COMMANDER
                         We're not talking about this...

                                     PASSENGER 1
                         They're talking over the same exact 
                         thing on the other boat.

                                     PASSENGER 2
                         If they're even bothering to talk.  
                         Let's put it to a vote.

         342   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, PRISONER FERRY -- NIGHT               342   

               As the Prisoners grow angrier, a CORRECTIONS OFFICER FIRES 
               his shotgun into the air.  The Prisoners back off.  Slightly.

                                                                       130.


         343   INT. PASSENGER LOUNGE, COMMUTER FERRY -- NIGHT               343   

               A GUARDSMAN on this boat passes around a hat.  People drop 
               CHITS into it.  Passengers filling out chits eye each other.

               People on their phones say goodbye to loved ones.

               The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks out across the water to 
               the other Ferry.  Looks up at the clock.  Ten to midnight...

               STARES down at his blank chit.

         344   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT           344   

               Gordon and his SWAT team leaders set up SNIPER and SCOPE 
               positions on the balustrade.

         345   INT. GARAGE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS                  345   

               A SWAT stands beside the empty school bus.

                                     SWAT
                         We've found our missing bus.

         346   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS      346   

               Gordon looks at the SWAT LEADER.

                                     GORDON
                         Then we have a hostage situation.

               They look across at the large windows of the Prewitt Building.  
               The Joker's men, in crude, homemade CLOWN MASKS are clearly 
               visible, automatic weapons in hand.

                                     SWAT SNIPER
                         I got hostages!

               They look through his scope.  Crouched deeper in the room, 
               PATIENTS, DOCTORS, and NURSES, huddled.

                                     GORDON
                         It's a shooting gallery.  Why'd he 
                         choose a spot with such big windows?

                                     BATMAN
                         He likes the view.

               Batman gestures towards the view of the ferries.

                                     SWAT LEADER
                         We have clear shots on five clowns.

                                     SWAT LEADER (CONT'D)
                         Snipers take them out, smash the 
                         windows- a team rappels in, a team 
                         moves in by the stairwells.  2 or 3 
                         or three casualties, max.

                                     GORDON
                              (barely hesitates)
                         Let's do it.

                                     BATMAN
                         It's not that simple.  With the Joker, 
                         it never is.

                                     GORDON
                         What's simple, is that every second 
                         we don't take him, those people on 
                         the ferries get closer to blowing 
                         each other up!

                                     BATMAN
                         That won't happen.

                                     GORDON
                         Then he'll blow them both up!  There's 
                         no time- we have to go in now-

                                     BATMAN
                         There's always a catch with him-

                                     GORDON
                         That's why we can't wait- we can't 
                         play his games-

               Batman turns.

                                     BATMAN
                         I need five minutes.  Alone-

                                     GORDON
                         No.  There's no time.  We have clear 
                         shots.

               Gordon pulls his gun.  Batman turns back.  The SWATS watch.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Dent's in there with them.  We have 
                         to save Dent!  I have to save Dent!
                              (to SWAT Leader)
                         Get ready-

               Batman LEAPS from the building, OPENS his cape- SOARS across 
               the gulf between the two buildings- Gordon puts his weapon 
               away.  Curses softly.  Turns to the SWAT leader.

               SMOKED GLASS EYEPIECES slip down over Batman's eye holes.

               Batman's SONAR POV.: the layers of the building dissolve, 
               levels of TRANSPARENCY PULSING rhythmically... Batman can

               The Joker is standing by the window, looking out at his 
               handiwork.  The Chechen's DOGS start BARKING.  He SMILES.

         351   EXT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS               351   

               Batman reaches into his utility belt, SPRAYS PLASTIC onto 
               the glass- lets it harden- PUNCHES the window-which BREAKS 
               QUIETLY as the pieces stick to the laminate- he slips inside-

         352   INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS               352   

               Batman's eyes glow white as he uses his sonar to look THROUGH

                         Hello, Jim.

                                     GORDON
                         Harvey?  What the hell's going on?

                                     DENT (O.S.)
                         You're about to know what my suffering 
                         is really like...

               Gordon looks across at the Prewitt penthouse...

                                     GORDON (O.S.)
                         Where are you?  Where's my family?!  

                                     DENT
                         Where my family died.

               Click.  Gordon looks at the SWAT leader.  Pale.

                                     SWAT LEADER
                         Red Team.  Go!

               Gordon moves to the door off the roof.

               Batman GRABS the Armed Clown, drops him, silently.  He goes 
               to disarm him- THE WEAPON IS DUCT-TAPED TO THE CLOWN'S HANDS.

               Batman RIPS off the clown mask:

               STARING, FRIGHTENED EYES- MOUTH DUCT-TAPED SHUT... it's ENGEL.

               Batman looks up: Four more clowns line the windows, weapons 
               duct-taped to their hands.  On SONAR: he looks into where 
               the hostages are crouched... the "PATIENTS" and "DOCTORS" 
               are carrying weapons- *these are the Joker's men*... Above 
               them SWATS RAPPEL FROM THE ROOFTOP.  In the stairwells, two 
               more teams prepping.

                                     BATMAN
                         Don't.  Move.

               Engel nods, terrified.

               The SWAT team arrives at the penthouse fire exit.  They spread 
               CHARGES across the inner wall-

               The SWAT Leader checks his watch.

               A SWAT Sniper zeroes in on a clown- the clown DISAPPEARS- 
               the Sniper looks up, confused-

               Batman yanks the clown along the floor using his grapple gun- 
               the clown takes down the two next to him- Batman leaps for 
               the nearest two as SHOTS SHATTER the glass-

               The SWATS rappel down the building- SWING in through the

               The "hostages" reel from the BLAST- The SWATS SWOOP in, aiming 
               weapons at the clowns, throwing PERCUSSION GRENADES- Batman 
               takes out the SWATS with fists and BATARANGS- The last SWAT 
               aims at BATMAN- behind him a "DOCTOR" raises a shotgun... 
               behind the "Doctor" Batman can see through the wall at SWATS 
               preparing to breach... Batman VAULTS over the SWAT into a 
               two-foot kick into the "Doctor's" chest-

               The Swats BLAST OUT THE WALL- the team leader steps up to 
               the hole... the BAT-GRAPPLE FIRES out-lodging in his kevlar 
               vest... he is YANKED, SCREAMING, through the door.  The rest 
               of his team look at each other.  Steel themselves.  Move in 
               through the hole...

         364   INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS               364   

               As the SWATS race in they find Engel, terrified, next to a 
               pile of unconscious "hostages", and their team leader, one 
               end of an absailing rope tied around his waist.  Batman is 
               on them, weaving KICKING, PUNCHING, and, with one hand, 
               clipping carabinners looped to the absailing rope onto their 
               webbing of vests.

               Batman steps back- picks up the team leader- SWAT weapons

               SWATS watch him go... the rope pays out... one by one they 
               are YANKED out of the window...

         365   EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING PREWITT BUILDING -- CONTINUOUS      365   

               A SNIPER watches through his scope as the six man SWAT team 
               soars out of the window and drops.  The line snaps taut and 
               they hang, like a mountaineering team in crisis.  Batman, 
               crouched in the broken window, secures the line.

                                     SNIPER
                         What the hell's he doing?

               Batman looks right at the sniper- Raises his grapple gun-

               BAM.  The bat grapple smashes into the Sniper's scope- the 
               rifle is YANKED out of his hands.

               The Warden and his men look at each other.  At the clock.

         369   INT. PENTHOUSE, PREWITT BUILDING -- NIGHT                    369   

               Batman WRESTLES with the Rotweilers- a blinding mass of 
               Batman, black fur and bared teeth-

               The Joker POPS a switchblade.  Moves in to the mass- Batman 
               KICKS OFF the last of the dogs- the Joker JABS his knife 
               into Batman's RIBS-

                                     THE JOKER
                         All the old familiar places.

               Batman recoils in pain.  The Joker BUTTS him- KNEES him-

               ENERGY explodes from his lean frame- he KICKS the injured 
               Batman back towards the glass...

               The Pilot [Passenger Ferry] looks at the remote in his hands.

                                     PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]
                         I voted for it.  Same as most of 
                         you.  Doesn't seem right that we 
                         should all die...

               Someone calls out from the back.

                                     PASSENGER 3
                         So do it!

                                     PILOT [PASSENGER FERRY]
                         I didn't say I'd do it.  Don't forget.  
                         We're still here.  Which means they 
                         haven't killed us, yet, either.

               He sets the remote down on a bench in the front of the lounge.  
               The other passengers and guardsmen stare at it...

               A HUGE, TATTOOED PRISONER pushes his way to the front.  He 
               walks towards the Warden, who is sweating, looking at the 
               remote.

                                     TATTOOED PRISONER
                         You don't wanna die.  But you don't 
                         know how to take a life.  Give it to 
                         me.

               The Warden looks at the remote.  At the clock.

                         These men will kill you and take it, 
                         anyway.  Give it to me, you can tell 
                         people I took it by force... give it 
                         to me and I'll do what you should 
                         have done ten minutes ago.

               Everyone stares at the remote.  One minute left.  The 
               Businessman stands.  Walks over and picks it up.

                                     BUSINESSMAN
                         No one wants to get their hands dirty.  
                         Fine.  I'll do it.  Those men on 
                         that boat made their choices.  They 
                         chose to murder and steal.  It makes 
                         no sense for us to die, too.

               He looks at the other passengers.  No one makes eye contact.

               The Warden slowly hands him the REMOTE.  The Prisoner looks 
               at it.  He looks the Warden in the eye...

               Then TOSSES the remote out the window.

               Warden, prisoners and officers are stunned.

               Batman FLIES backwards THROUGH THE WINDOW- glass flying- the 
               Joker KICKS out a wooden brace holding up the STEEL FRAME-
               Batman's arms fly up as it comes crashing down onto his neck- 
               saved by his protective gauntlets.  Batman GRUNTS as the 
               Joker STEPS onto the steel beam...

                                     THE JOKER
                         If we don't stop fighting, we're 
                         going to miss the fireworks.

                                     BATMAN
                         There won't be any fireworks.

               Batman STRUGGLES to keep the beam from CRUSHING his neck...

               The Businessman stares at the remote in his hands.  Finally, 
               he puts it down.  Sits down.  Waits to die.

               The clock strikes MIDNIGHT.

               Batman indicates the clock... twelve o'clock.

                         What were you hoping to prove?  That 
                         deep down, we're all as ugly as you?

               The Joker looks at the clock...

               The smile disappears from the Joker's face.

                                     BATMAN
                         You're alone.

               The Joker CROUCHES down, hovering above Batman's face and 
               arms.  Shows him the remote.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Can't rely on anyone these days.

               The Joker ARMS the remote...

                         Have to do everything yourself.  I 
                         always have- and it's not always 
                         easy...
                              (smiles, remembering)
                         You know how I got these scars?

               Batman looks up at him.

                                     BATMAN
                         No.  But I know how you get these-

               Batman's SCALLOP BLADES FIRE OUT OF HIS GAUNTLET, nailing 
               the Joker in the chest and arm- he STAGGERS back- Batman, 
               freed, leaps forward- KICKS HIM OVER THE EDGE- GRABS the 
               remote-

               The Joker GIGGLES as he FALLS, enjoying the ride.  Something 
               SLAMS into his leg, and he JERKS to a stop- BATMAN'S GRAPPLE.

               The Joker HOLLERS in pain as Batman HAULS him up.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Just couldn't let me go, could you?

                         object.  You truly are incorruptible, 
                         aren't you?

               Batman secures the Joker UPSIDE DOWN.  The Joker is LAUGHING.

                                     THE JOKER (CONT'D)
                         You won't kill me out of some 
                         misplaced sense of self-
                         righteousness... and I won't kill 
                         you because you're too much fun.  
                         We're going to do this forever.

                                     BATMAN
                         You'll be in a padded cell, forever.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Maybe we can share it.  They'll need 
                         to double up, the rate this city's 
                         inhabitants are losing their minds...

                                     BATMAN
                         This city just showed you it's full 
                         of people ready to believe in good.

               The Joker looks up at him.  A twinkle in his eye.

                                     THE JOKER
                         Till their spirit breaks completely.  
                         Until they find out what I did with 
                         the best of them.  Until they get a 
                         good look at the real Harvey Dent, 
                         and all the heroic things he's done.
                              (indicates ferry)
                         Then those criminals will be straight 
                         back onto the streets and Gotham 
                         will understand the true nature of 
                         heroism.
                              (off look)
                         You didn't think I'd risk losing the 
                         battle for the soul of Gotham in a 
                         fist fight with you?  You've got to 
                         have an ace in the hole.  Mine's 
                         Harvey.

               Batman hauls the Joker up, nose to nose.

                                     BATMAN
                         What did you do?

                                     THE JOKER
                         I took Gotham's white knight.

                         And I brought him down to my level.  
                         It wasn't hard- madness is like 
                         gravity.  All it takes is a little 
                         push.

               Joker laughs.  Batman leaves him to the SWATS.

                         Lucius.  Find Harvey Dent.

         379   EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT                   379   

               Gordon gets out of his car, gun drawn.  Makes his way into 
               the blackened wreck of a building...

         380   INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- NIGHT                   380   

               Gordon peers into the darkness.

                                     GORDON
                         Dent?

               No reply.  Gordon makes his way deeper.  Up the stairs.

         381   INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT                  381   

               Gordon spots Barbara and their two children huddled together.  
               He moves towards them- Barbara is shaking her head-

               WHAM!  Dent cracks Gordon over the head with his gun.  Dent 
               disarms Gordon, rolls him over.  He turns to look at the 
               ENORMOUS hole in the floor.  From this side, in the moonlight, 
               Dent looks completely normal.

                                     DENT
                         This is where they brought her, 
                         Gordon.  After your people handed 
                         her over.  This is where they bound 
                         her.  This is where she suffered.  
                         This is where she died.

                                     GORDON
                         I know.  I was here.  Trying to save 
                         her.

               Dent TURNS, revealing his dark side.

                                     DENT
                         But you didn't, did you?

                                     GORDON
                         I couldn't.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       141.


                                     DENT
                         Yes, you could.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         If you'd listened to me- if you'd 
                         stood up against corruption instead 
                         of doing your deal with the devil.

                                     GORDON
                         I was trying to fight the mob-

               Dent MOVES towards Gordon.

                                     DENT
                         You wouldn't dare try to justify 
                         yourself if you knew what I'd lost.  
                         Have you ever had to talk to the 
                         person you love most, wondering if 
                         you're about to listen to them die?  
                         You ever had to lie to that person?  
                         Tell them it's going to be all right, 
                         when you know it's not?  Well, you're 
                         about to find out what that feels 
                         like.  Then you'll be able to look 
                         me in the eye and tell me you're 
                         sorry.

               Dent turns- steps over to Barbara- puts the gun to her temple-

                                     GORDON
                         Harvey.  Put the gun down.  You're 
                         not going to hurt my family.

                                     DENT
                         No, just the person you need most.
                              (cocks gun)
                         So is it your wife?

                                     GORDON
                         Put the gun down.

               Dent moves the gun to point at Gordon's little girl.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Please, Harvey...

               Dent moves to James Gordon.  Brushes the hair out of the 
               boy's eyes with the muzzle.  Gordon SNAPS.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Goddamit.  Stop pointing that gun at 
                         my family, Dent.

                                     DENT
                         We have a winner.

               Dent pulls the boy away from his mother.

                                     BARBARA
                         No!  Jim stop him!  Don't let him!

               Dent walks James past Gordon to the edge of the burnt floor.  
               He touches the raw wood at the edge of the floor.

                                     GORDON
                         I'm sorry, Harvey.  For everything.  
                         But, please.  Please don't hurt him.

               SIRENS.

         382   EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS              382   

               Cop cars descend on the warehouse.

         383   INT. SECOND FLOOR, BURNT WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS             383   

               Dent looks at Gordon, FURIOUS.

                                     DENT
                         You brought your cops?

                                     GORDON
                         All they know is there's a situation.  
                         They don't know who, or what.  They're 
                         just creating a perimeter.

                                     DENT
                         You think I want to escape?!  There's
                         No escape from this-

               Dent indicates his face.  His suffering.

                                     GORDON
                         No one needs to escape, because no 
                         one's done anything wrong.  And nobody 
                         has to.

               Dent chuckles.  A macabre sight.

                                     DENT
                         I've done plenty wrong, Gordon.  
                         Just not quite enough.  Yet.

               Dent squeezes the gun a little tighter against the little 
               boy's neck.  The boy WHIMPERS.

                                     BATMAN
                         You don't want to hurt the boy, Dent.

               Dent turns.  Batman steps from the shadows.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       143.


                                     DENT
                         It's not about what I want.  It's 
                         about what's fair.
                              (to Gordon and Batman)
                         You thought we could be decent men 
                         in an indecent world.  You thought 
                         we could lead by example.  You thought 
                         the rules could be bent but not 
                         break... you were wrong.  The world 
                         is cruel.
                              (shows his coin)
                         And the only morality in a cruel 
                         world is chance.  Unbiased.  
                         Unprejudiced.  Fair.

                                     BATMAN
                         Nothing fair ever came out of the 
                         barrel of a gun, Dent.

                                     DENT
                              (shows the coin)
                         His boy's got the same chance she 
                         had.  Fifty-fifty.

               Batman steps closer, desperate, trying to reach Dent.

                                     BATMAN
                         What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.  
                         We decided to act.  We three.  We 
                         knew the risks and we acted as one.  
                         We are all responsible for the 
                         consequences.

               Dent looks at Batman.  Pleading.

                                     DENT
                         Then why was it only me who lost 
                         everything?

               Batman looks into Dent's eyes.  Emotional.

                                     BATMAN
                         It wasn't.

                                     DENT
                              (furious)
                         The Joker chose me!

                                     BATMAN
                         Because you were the best of us.  He 
                         wanted to prove that even someone as 
                         good as you could fall.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                       144.


                                     DENT
                              (bitter)
                         And he was right.

                                     BATMAN
                         But you're fooling yourself if you 
                         think you're letting chance decide.  
                         You're the one pointing the gun, 
                         Harvey.  So point it at the people 
                         who were responsible.  We all acted 
                         as one.  Gordon.  Me.  And you.

               Dent is listening, the wheels in his deranged mind turning.

                                     DENT
                         Fair enough.

               Dent eases his grip on the boy.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         You first.

               He points the gun at Batman.  FLIPS the coin.  TAILS.  He 
               SHOOTS.  Batman COLLAPSES to the ground, clutching his gut.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         My turn.

               He points the gun at his own head.  FLIPS the coin.  HEADS.

               He looks a little disappointed.

               Finally, he points the gun back at Gordon's son.

                                     DENT (CONT'D)
                         Your turn, Gordon.

                                     GORDON
                         You're right, Harvey.  Rachel's death
                         Was my fault.  But punish me-

                                     DENT
                         I'm about to.  Tell your son it's 
                         going to be all right, Gordon.  Lie.  
                         Like I lied.

               Gordon looks up.  Pained.  Locks eyes with his son.

                                     GORDON
                         It's going to be all right, son.

               Dent FLIPS the coin.  High.  Dent's eyes FOLLOW the coin up- 
               Batman HURLS himself at Dent and the boy.

               All three of them VANISH over the edge.  A TERRIBLE CRASH-
               then silence, but for the sound of DENT'S COIN, SPINNING on 
               the floor at the edge of the hole.

               Gordon, horrified, RUNS to the edge- peers down- Dent lies 
               at the bottom of the hole, his neck broken.  DEAD.

               The coin stops spinning, GOOD SIDE UP.

               Gordon's son swings into view, HANGING from Batman, who is 
               holding onto a JOIST with all his strength...

               Gordon reaches down to GRAB his son- HAULS him up...

               Batman FALLS..., dropping and dropping, SMASHING THROUGH 
               protruding WOOD and PIPES... He lands HARD near Dent.

         384   EXT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS              384   

               The cops prepare to STORM the front door.

         385   INT. BURNT WAREHOUSE, 52ND STREET -- CONTINUOUS              385   

               Gordon races down the stairs.  Rushes over to Batman.

                                     JAMES
                         Dad, is he okay?

               Gordon crouches at Batman's side.  The Batman GRASPS Gordon's 
               arm.  STAGGERS to his feet.

                                     GORDON
                         Thank-you.

                                     BATMAN
                         You don't have to-

                                     GORDON
                         Yes, I do.

               Gordon and Batman stare down at Dent's body.  Grave.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         The Joker won.

               Gordon stares down at SCARRED SIDE of Harvey Dent.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         Harvey's prosecution, everything he 
                         fought for, everything Rachel died 
                         for.  Undone.  Whatever chance Gotham 
                         had of fixing itself... whatever 
                         chance you gave us of fixing our 
                         city... dies with Harvey's reputation.

                                     GORDON (CONT'D)
                         We bet it all on him.  The Joker 
                         took the best of us and tore him 
                         down.  People will lose all hope.

                                     BATMAN
                         No.  They won't.
                              (looks at Gordon)
                         They can never know what he did.

                                     GORDON
                              (incredulous)
                         Five dead?  Two of them cops?  We 
                         can't sweep that under-

                                     BATMAN
                         No.  But the Joker cannot win.

               Batman crouches to Dent's body.

                                     BATMAN (CONT'D)
                         Gotham needs its true hero.

               Gently, he turns Dent's head so the good side of his face is 
               up.  Gordon looks from Dent's face to Batman.  Understanding.

                                     GORDON
                         You?  You can't-

                                     BATMAN
                         Yes, I can.

               Batman stands.  Faces Gordon.

                         You either die a hero or live long 
                         enough to see yourself become the 
                         villain.  I can do those things 
                         because I'm not a hero, like Dent.  
                         I killed those people.  That's what 
                         I can be.

                                     GORDON
                              (angry)
                         No, you can't!  You're not!

               Batman hands Gordon his police radio.

           GORDON (V.O)
           Harvey Dent was needed. He was
           everything Gotham has been crying
           out for. He was...a hero. Not the
           hero we deserved - the hero we
           needed. Nothing less than a knight,
           shining...

                         
          The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.
          The shape of a BAT. The ice disintegrates...

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          Gordon stands before a massive picture of Harvey Dent.

                          GORDON
           But I knew Harvey Dent. I was...his
           friend. And it will be a very long
           time before someone inspires us the
           way he did.
          Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
          eulogy.
           I believed in Harvey Dent.
          And we FADE TO BLACK.

                          CUT TO:

                         
          Racing along a cratered dirt road, and we are -

                         

          INT. LAND CRUISER JOSTLING OVER UNEVEN TERRAIN - DAY

          Three Hooded Men guarded by East European Militia. A third
          Militia drives. Next to him is a nervous, bespectacled man.

                         

          EXT. AIRSTRIP, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

          An airstrip overlooking a grey city rocked by artillery
          fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,
          stands in front of a commuter plane. CIA Man watches the
          Land Cruiser pull up, hard. The Militia Men jump out of the
          vehicle.
          The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA
          Man.

           2.

           Why would I want them?

                          DRIVER
           They were trying to grab your
           prize. (Smiles.) They work for the
           mercenary. The masked man.

                          (EXCITED)
           Bane?
          The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Get 'em on board - I'll call it in.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY

          The commuter plane struggles over snow-capped mountains.

           What are you doing in the middle of
           my operation?

           3.

                         
          Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.
           The flight plan I just filed with
           the Agency lists me, my men, and
           Dr. Pavel here. But only one of
           you.
          CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man
          1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

                         

                          CIA MAN

           FIRST ONE TO TALK GETS TO STAY ON
           MY AIRCRAFT! (Cocks weapon.)

           SO...WHO PAID YOU TO GRAB DR.

           PAVEL?!

                         
          Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special
          Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

                          CIA MAN

           HE DIDN'T FLY SO GOOD! WHO WANTS TO

           TRY NEXT?!

                         
          The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

                          CIA MAN

           TELL ME ABOUT BANE! WHY DOES HE

           WEAR THE MASK?!

                         
          The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the
          man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

                          CIA MAN

           LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED GUN!

                         

           THIRD PRISONER (O.S.)
           Or he's wondering why someone would
           shoot a man before throwing him out
           of an aeroplane.

                         
          CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

                          CIA MAN
           Wiseguy, huh? At least you can
           talk. Who are you?

                         

                          THIRD PRISONER
           We are nothing. We are the dirt
           beneath your feet. And no one cared
           who I was until I put on the
           mask...

                         
          CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his
          hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The
          eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

           4.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Who we are does not matter. What
           matters is our plan.

                          CIA MAN

                          (FASCINATED)
           If I pull this off, will you die?

                          BANE
           It would be extremely painful.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You're a big guy -

                          BANE
           For you.

                         

                          CIA MAN

                          (UNNERVED)
           Was being caught part of your plan?

                          BANE
           Of course. Dr. Pavel refused our
           offer in favor of yours. We had to
           know what he told you about us.

           DR. PAVEL
           Nothing! I said nothing!

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Why not just ask him?

                          BANE
           He would not have told us.

                         

                          CIA MAN
           You have methods.

                          BANE
           Him, I need healthy. You present no
           such problem.
          CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass
          tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The commuter plane is dwarfed by a massive transport plane
          looming over it, dangerously close...

           5.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The plane lurches. The noise is building.

                          SERGEANT
           Sir?

                         

                          CIA MAN
           Well congratulations, you got
           yourselves caught. What's the next
           step of your master plan?

                         

                          BANE
           Crashing this plane...

                         

          EXT. MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The ramp of the transport opens... Four men leap out on
          tethers - dropping towards the commuter plane, two each
          side...

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Spacial Forces react to the turbulence from the plane
          above. CIA Man looks at Bane.

                          BANE

                          (RISING)
           With no survivors.
          A Special Forces soldier spins around - an Armed Man is
          outside the window. Bang -

                         

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          Two men shoot through the windows, the other two attach
          grapples to the fuselage - give the thumbs up - hoists start
          to pull and the tail of the commuter plane is lifted,
          unnaturally.

                         

          INT. COCKPIT, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          The Pilots battle the controls as the plane tilts forward.

           6.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Like lightning, Bane has the CIA Man is his handcuffed arms,
          legs wrapped around a seat back, The entire cabin upends.
          Tumbling chaos - Soldiers falling - Bane cracks CIA Man's
          neck and drops him onto the Sergeant - they tumble down the
          plane, smashing into the cockpit door with a terminal thud.
          Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of
          him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

                         

                         

          EXT. ATLAS MOUNTAINS - CONTINUOUS

          The men climb the tail of the smaller plane as it dangles
          helplessly above the mountains. Its wings shear off.

                         

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          Bane breaks his handcuffs as if they were plastic, then
          opens his legs and drops down the cabin, somersaulting
          gracefully and using his arms to stop himself halfway down,
          by Dr. Pavel.

                         

          EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAIN RANGE - CONTINUOUS

          The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,
          swinging out as the tail explodes.

                         

          INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

          An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the
          Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.
          A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the
          seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body
          the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

                         
          Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of
          surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -
          runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,
          horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,
          drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the
          body...

                         
          An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and
          out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

           7.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Friend. They expect one of us in
           the wreckage.
          The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

                         

                          HOODED MAN 2
           Have we started the fire?

                          BANE

                          (NODS)
           The fire rises.
          Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.
          Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.
          Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

                         

                          BANE
           Calm, Doctor. Now is not time for
           fear...
          Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the
          vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

                         

                          BANE
           That comes later.
          Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around
          them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.
          Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,
          and we -

                          CUT TO:

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM - EVENING

          Drifting over the vast city...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent Day may not be our
           oldest public holiday...
          ...moving past the enormous Gotham Bridge...

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           But we're here tonight because it's
           one of the most important...
          ...over the Gotham river to the Palisades on the far side...

           8.

                         

                         

           MAYOR (V.O.)
           Harvey Dent's uncompromising stand
           against organized crime and, yes,
           ultimately, his sacrifice, have
           made Gotham a safer place than it
           was at the time of his death, eight
           years ago...
          ...finding a party in the grounds of Wayne Manor. The Mayor
          addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.

                         

                          MAYOR
           This city has seen a historic
           turnaround. No city is without
           crime. But this city is without
           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I
           say...not on my watch.
          Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
           I want to thank the Wayne
           Foundation for hosting this event.
           I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
           tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
           in spirit...

                         
          High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Now I'm going to give way to an
           important voice...

                         
          Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
          sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Commissioner.

                         

                          GORDON
           Congressman.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
           these things?
          Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
          cuts in.

           9.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           No one has. Not in years.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           He can tell you about the bad old
           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.
          The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
          grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Sweetheart, not so fast with the
           chow.

                          MAID
           (turns, tight smile)
           Shrimp balls?
          The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
          Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           Jim Gordon can tell you the truth
           about Harvey Dent...

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
           We're gonna be here all night.

                          GORDON
           Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
           so simple, Congressman.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           But I'll let him tell you himself -
           Commissioner Gordon?
          Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
          speech. Thinks.

                          GORDON
           The truth...?
          INSERT CUT: Harvey Dent, face half destroyed, threatens
          Gordon's son with a handgun.

           10.

                         

                         
          Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.
           I have written a speech telling the
           truth about Harvey Dent...
          Gordon folds up his speech.
           Maybe the time isn't right...
          Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
          mutters under his breath.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Thank Christ for that...

                          GORDON
           Maybe right now all you need to
           know is that there are a thousand
           inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
           direct result of the Dent Act.
           These are violent criminals,
           essential cogs in the organized
           crime machine that terrorized
           Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
           all I should say about Harvey
           Dent's death is this...it has not
           been for nothing.
          The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
          People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
          Foley.

                         

                          GORDON
           The second shift reports in?

                          FOLEY
           On your desk. But you should put in
           some more time with the Mayor -

                          GORDON
           That's your department.

                         
          Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Anyone shown him the crime stats?

                          FOLEY
           He goes by his gut, and it
           continues to bother him, whatever
           the numbers.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Must be popular with the wife.

           11.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           Not really. She took the kids and
           moved to Cleveland.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           He'll have plenty of time for
           visits. Mayor's dumping him in the
           spring.

                          FOLEY
           Really? He's a hero.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN
           War hero. This is peacetime. Stay
           smart, the job's yours.

                         

                         

          INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
          Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

                          MAID 2
           They say he never leaves the East
           Wing.

                          MAID 3
           I heard he had an accident - that
           he's disfigured.

                         
          The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
          died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Till, why are your people using
           the main stairs?
          Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
          plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Where's Mrs. Bolton?

                          MAID
           She's up at the bar, sir. Can I
           help?

                         
          Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.

                          ALFRED
           The East drawing room. Unlock the
           door, place the tray on the table,
           lock the door again. Nothing more.

           12.

                         

                         
          The Maid nods. Takes the tray.

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Following the Maid through the empty house. She comes to the
          large oak door to the East Wing. Unlocks it...

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          The room is dark, quiet. The Maid places the tray on the
          table. She looks at the inner door opposite. It is ajar...

                         

          INT. HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred talks to an elegant woman, thirties, Miranda Tate.

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Miss Tate, but I've
           tried. He won't see you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           It's important, Mr. Pennyworth.
          Her accent is European. Hard to place.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Wayne is as determined to
           ignore important things as trivial
           ones.

           MALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Don't take it personally, Miranda.

                         
          They turn to see a man in his fifties. Daggett.

                          DAGGETT
           Everyone knows Wayne's holed up in
           there with eight-inch nails, peeing
           into Mason jars. (To Alfred.) Good
           of you to let me on the grounds.

                          ALFRED
           The Dent Act is about all Gotham.
           Even you, Mr. Daggett. Miss Tate,
           always a pleasure.
          Alfred turns and walks off. Daggett smiles, glib.

           13.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Why waste your time talking to the
           man who threw away your investment
           on some save-the-world vanity
           project? He can't help you get your
           money back. But I can.

                          MIRANDA
           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,
           Mr. Daggett, but you understand
           only money and the power you think
           it buys, so why waste my time,
           indeed?

                         
          She walks away. Daggett watches her go.

                         

          INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

                         

          INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and
          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.
           It is Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

                         
          Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

                          MAID
           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...
          She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

                          WAYNE
           Is that what they say about me?

           14.

                         

                          MAID
           It's just that...nobody sees you...

                         
          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE
           I'm afraid I can't let you take
           those.

                         
          She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

                          MAID
           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

                         

          EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her
          white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and
          pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she
          slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

           15.

                         

                         

                          MAID
           Can I have a ride?
          The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           You read my mind.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER


                         
          Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

                          ALFRED
           Miss Tate was asking to see you
           again.

                         

                          WAYNE
           She's very persistent.

                          ALFRED
           And quite lovely, in case you were
           wondering.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I wasn't.

                          ALFRED
           What are you doing?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Examining print dust. We've been
           robbed.

                          ALFRED
           And this is your idea of raising
           the alarm?

                          WAYNE

                          (SHRUGS)
           She took the pearls. Tracking
           device and all.

                          ALFRED
           She?

                         

                          WAYNE
           One of the maids, perhaps you
           should stop letting them in this
           side of the house.

           16.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           Perhaps you should learn to make
           your own bed, then. Why are you
           dusting for prints?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not. She was.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon brings a stack of files against the air duct, settles
          to read. Next to him is a rusty, broken searchlight.

           YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
           Sir?

                         
          A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

                          BLAKE
           I didn't want to bother you up
           here, but they're looking for you.

                         

                          GORDON
           What's the problem, son?

                          BLAKE
           Congressman Gilly's wife's been
           calling. He hasn't made it home
           from the Wayne Foundation event.

                          GORDON
           That's a job for the police?

                          BLAKE
           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.
           Pretty soon we'll be chasing
           overdue library books.
          Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

                          BLAKE
           But here you are. Like we're still
           at war...

                          GORDON
           Old habits.

           17.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           Or instinct.

                          GORDON
           What's your name, son?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Blake, sir.

                          GORDON
           You have something you want to ask
           me, Officer Blake?

                          BLAKE
           It's that night. This night, eight
           years ago. The night Dent died.

                         

                          GORDON
           What about it?

                          BLAKE
           The last confirmed sighting of the
           Batman. He murders those people,
           takes out two SWAT teams, breaks
           Dent's neck...then just vanishes?

                          GORDON
           I'm not hearing a question, son.

                         
          Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you want to know who we was?
          Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes
          his fingers across its rusted shell.

                          GORDON
           I know exactly who he was. (Turns
           to Blake.) He was Batman.

                         
          Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Let's go see about the
           Congressman's wife...

           18.

                         

          INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne?
          Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

                         

                         

          INT. STUDY, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          Alfred hits three notes on the piano. The bookcase opens.

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

          Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to
          lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with
          a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to
          where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You haven't been down here in a
           long time...

                          WAYNE
           Just trying to find out more about
           our jewel thief. I ran her prints
           from the photos she handled -
          Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery
          suspect.
           - but she was wearing someone
           else's fingerprints. She's good.

                          ALFRED
           She may be. But we have the trace
           on the necklace.

                         

                          WAYNE
           We do, so I cross-referenced the
           address she went back to with
           police data on high-end
           B-and-E's...

                         
          Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.
           Selina Kyle. The databases are full
           of close calls, tips from fences...

           19.

                         
          Newspaper headlines appear -

           She won't. She likes them too much.
           And they weren't what she was
           after.

                          ALFRED
           What was she after?

                         

                          WAYNE
           My fingerprints. There was printer
           toner mixed with graphite on the
           safe. Gives you a good pull, and
           it's untraceable.

                         

                          ALFRED
           Fascinating. Maybe you should
           exchange notes over coffee.

                          WAYNE
           Now you're trying to set me up with
           a jewel thief?

                          ALFRED
           At this point, sir, I would set you
           up with a chimpanzee if I thought
           it would bring you back into the
           world.

                          WAYNE
           There's nothing out there for me.

                         

                          ALFRED
           And that's the problem. You hung up
           the cape and cowl, but never moved
           on. You won't get out there and
           find a life. Find someone -

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (BITTER)
           I did find someone, Alfred.

           20.

                         

                         

                          ALFRED
           I know. And then you lost them.
           That's part of living, sir. But
           you're not living - you're waiting.
           Hoping for things to go bad again.

                         
          Wayne says nothing.
           Remember when you left Gotham?
           Before all this. Before Batman.
           Seven years you were gone. Seven
           years I waited. Hoping that you
           wouldn't come back.
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.
           Every year I took my holiday. I'd
           go to Florence. There's a café by
           the Arno... Any fine evening I
           would sit there and order a Fernet
           Branca...
          INSERT CUT: Alfred seated in a café sipping his drink...
           I had a fantasy. I liked to imagine
           that one day I'd look across the
           tables, and see you. Sitting there
           with your wife. Perhaps some kids.
           You wouldn't say anything to me, or
           me to you, but we'd both
           know...that you'd made it. That you
           were happy.

                         
          INSERT CUT: Alfred spots a couple at another table and looks
          closer, hopeful. But they are strangers.
           I never wanted you to come back to
           Gotham. I knew there was nothing
           there for you but pain and tragedy,
           and I wanted more for you than
           that. I still do.
          Alfred leaves Wayne to his cave. His bats.

                         

                         

          EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - DAY

          Blake and his partner, Ross, get out of their patrol car. A
          DWP Man leads them down a long concrete trough.

                         

                          DWP MAN
           They wash up a couple times a
           month. More when in gets colder -
           homeless sheltering in the tunnels.
           We had to pull him to clear the
           basin, but other than that we
           didn't touch him...

           21.

                         

                         
          They come out by the catchment basin. Above the grille lies
          a body - a teenage boy. Blake looks down at him. Freezes.

                          ROSS
           What?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Name's Jimmy. He's at St.
           Swithin's. (Off look.) The boys
           home where I...I coach some ball.

                         

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - DAY

          Blake looks up at the shabby building.

                         

                         

          INT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - MOMENTS LATER

          Blake is talking to Father Reilly.

                          FATHER REILLY
           Jimmy hadn't been here for months.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          FATHER REILLY
           You know why, Blake - he aged out.
           We don't have the resources to keep
           boys on after sixteen -

                          BLAKE
           The Wayne Foundation gives money
           for that -

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Not for two years now.

                          BLAKE
           He has a brother here, right?

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Mark. I'll tell him.

                          BLAKE
           I'd like to, if that's okay.

           22.

                         

                         

          EXT. PLAYGROUND, ST. SWITHIN'S - MOMENTS LATER

          Father Reilly watches as Blake sits with Mark - ten.

                          BLAKE
           I'm sorry.

                         
          Mark nods slowly. Staring straight ahead.

                          BLAKE
           What was he doing in the tunnels?

                         

                          MARK
           Lot of guys been going down the
           tunnels when they age out. Say you
           can live down there. Say there's
           work down there.

                         

                          BLAKE
           What kind of work are you gonna
           find in the sewers?

                          MARK
           More than you can find up here, I
           guess.
          Blake considers this. Troubled.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

          Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk
          in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks
          over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.

                         

                          STRYVER
           You brought a date?

                          SELINA
           I like having someone around to
           open doors for me.

                         
          Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.
          Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.

                          SELINA
           Right hand. No partials.
          Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it
          up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.

           23.

                         

                         

                          STRYVER
           Very nice.
          He pockets the envelope.

                          SELINA
           Not so fast, handsome. You got
           something for me?

                          STRYVER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug
          joins them at the table. Selina smiles.

                          SELINA
           I don't know what you're going to
           do with Mr. Wayne's prints...but
           I'm guessing you'll need his thumb.
          As Stryver checks the envelope again -

                          SELINA
           You don't count so good, huh?

                          STRYVER
           I count fine.
          The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.

                         

                          STRYVER
           In fact, I'm counting to ten right
           now...
          Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She
          blinks.

                          SELINA
           Okay, okay -

                         
          She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in
          himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

                          SELINA
           My friend is waiting outside. Just
           hit 'send'...

                         
          Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her
          options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The
          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

           24.

                         

                         

                          JEN
           Place is a little dead.

                          SELINA
           (takes envelope, tense)
           It'll liven up in a minute, trust
           me.

                          JEN
           Everything okay?

                         

                          SELINA
           Great. Catch you later.
          Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.

                          SELINA
           It would've been a lot easier to
           just give me what we agreed.

                          STRYVER
           We can't have loose ends. And even
           in that dress, no one's going to
           miss you.

                          SELINA
           No. But my friend over there...?
          Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of
          nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...

                          SELINA
           Every cop in the city's missing
           him.

                         
          Across the bar, the TV on mute -

          MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.
          Stryver looks at Selina.

                         

                          STRYVER
           Cute. But they're not gonna be
           looking in a place like this.

                          SELINA
           I don't know... You did just use
           his cell phone.
          Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the
          Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units
          descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -
          SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs

           25.

                         

                         
          Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the
          other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.
          Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.

                          SWAT
           It's alright, Miss. Just stay down

                          -
          The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back
          through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

                         

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs turn and open up on the SWATs with automatic
          weapons.

                         

                         

          INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina moves to the door. Spots the Congressman under the
          bar, clutching his bleeding leg.

                         

                          SELINA
           Keep some pressure on that,
           sweetheart.
          She adjusts her dress in the broken mirror behind the bar.
          Moves for the door.

                         

                          CONGRESSMAN

                          (WEAK)
           Call me?

                         

                         

          EXT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          Selina waltzes out - right into Blake. She feigns panic.

                          SELINA
           There's a man in there - he's
           bleeding!

                          BLAKE
           It's okay, Miss. It's okay.

                         
          Blake helps Selina down onto the tailgate of a SWAT truck.
          He heads into the bar, weapon drawn. Selina slips behind the
          truck and into the night.

           26.

                          (INTO RADIO)
           I've got the Congressman - bullet
           to the leg, but he's okay.

                         

          EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then
          race around a corner into a smaller passage.
          A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon
          jumps out, gun drawn.

                         
          The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners
          tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,
          counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.
          The passage is empty.

                         
          The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -

                          GORDON
           Manhole!

                         
          He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,
          Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.

                          GORDON
           You three, down with me. You two,
           head down to cover the next exit -

                         

                          SWAT
           Where -?

                          GORDON
           Get the DWP down here, now!

                         
          Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon moves down the tunnel, flashlight low. Three SWATs
          fall in behind...

           27.

          Blake comes into the alley. Cops surround the manhole.

           Where's the DWP guy?

                         

                          BLAKE
           They went down there?

          Gordon hears a noise up ahead - pushes forward, rounds the
          corner. BANG! GUNFIRE. SWATs return fire, shots sparking off
          the concrete walls, then - BOOM - behind him the tunnel
          ERUPTS IN FIRE, blasting the SWATs. Gordon races forward,
          tearing through the tunnels.

          Gordon races around a corner, gun drawn. A noise makes him

           Come on, we gotta get down there -

                         

                          COP
           That was a gas explosion, kid -

           Gas? This is a sewer!

          Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.

                          THUG 1
           This one's alive. (Looks closer.)
           Jesus. It's the Police
           Commissioner.

                          THUG 2
           What do we do?

                         

                          THUG 1
           Take him to Bane.
          The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.
          As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular
          men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls
          and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed
          Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They
          stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon
          between two waterfalls, into -

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

          They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the
          firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked
          line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...

                         

                          BANE
           Why are you here?
          The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.

                         

                          THUG 1
           Answer him!
          Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.

           29.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           I'm asking you.

                          THUG 1
           It's the Police Commissioner.

                         

                          BANE
           And you brought him down here?

                          THUG 2
           We didn't know what to do. We -

                         

                          BANE
           You panicked. And your weakness
           costs three lives.

                          THUG 1
           No, he's alone -
          Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.
          Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.

                          BANE
           Search him. Then I will kill you.
          The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,
          gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.
          Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at
          the papers. Unfolds them...

                         
          As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the
          rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...

                          THUG 2
           He's dead.

                         
          Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...

                          BANE
           Then show me his body.

                         

                          THUG 2
           That water runs to any one of the
           outflows - we'd never find him.
          Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.

                         

                          BANE
           Give me your GPS.
          Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's
          jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.

           30.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Follow him.

                          THUG 2
           Follow him?

                         
          Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead
          Mercenary.

                          BANE
           Track him. Make sure both bodies
           will not be found. Then brick up
           the south tunnel.

          Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something
          stuck up against the grille, thrusts his hand into the
          raging waters - Gordon is there, alive. Just. Blake pulls
          him up onto the concrete, hoists him up, hurrying...

           I need to see Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          ALFRED
           I'm sorry, Mr. Wayne doesn't take
           unscheduled calls. Even from police
           officers.

                         

                          BLAKE
           And if I go get a warrant, in the
           investigation of Harvey Dent's
           murder? Would that still count as
           unscheduled?

          Blake is sitting, drumming his leg, nervous. Wayne enters.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What can I do for you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           Commissioner Gordon's been shot.

           31.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm sorry to hear that -

                          BLAKE
           He chased a gunman down into the
           sewers. When I pulled him out he
           was babbling about an underground
           army. A masked man called 'Bane'.

                          WAYNE
           Shouldn't you be telling this to
           your superior officers?

                          BLAKE
           I did. One of them asked if he saw
           any giant alligators down there. He
           needs you. He needs the Batman.

                         

                          WAYNE
           If Commissioner Gordon thinks I'm
           the Batman he must be in a bad way

                          -

                         

                          BLAKE
           He doesn't know or care who you
           are. (Off look.) But we've met
           before. When I was a kid. At the
           orphanage. See, my mom died when I
           was small. Car accident, I don't
           really remember it. But a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt. I remember that just
           fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like, do they? To be angry. In your
           bones. People understand, foster
           parents understand. For a while.
           Then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do.
           To move on. To forget.

                         
          Wayne stares at Blake.

                          BLAKE
           So they stopped understanding and
           sent the angry kid to a boys' home
           - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
           by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
           figured it out too late. You have
           to hide the anger. Practice smiling
           in the mirror. Like putting on a
           mask. You showed up one day in a
           cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

                          BLAKE (CONT'D)
           We were so excited - Bruce Wayne,
           billionaire orphan. We made up
           stories about you. Legends. The
           other boys' stories were just that.
           But when I saw you I knew who you
           really were... (Beat.) I'd seen
           that look on your face. Same one I
           taught myself.
          Blake gets up to leave. Wayne is lost in thought.

                         

                          BLAKE
           I don't know why you took the fall
           for Dent's murder, but I'm still a
           believer in the Batman. Even if
           you're not.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why did you say your boys' home
           used to be funded by the Wayne
           Foundation?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Because the money stopped. Might be
           time to get some fresh air and
           start paying attention to the
           details. Some of those details
           might need your help.

           You checked that name? 'Bane' -

           Ran it through some databases. He's
           a mercenary. No other known name.
           Never been seen or photographed
           without a mask. He and his men were
           behind a coup in West Africa that

           It would seem so. I'll keep

                          WAYNE
           Why did the Wayne Foundation stop

           The Foundation is funded from the

           No. Do we still have any cars

           One or two.

           And I need an appointment at the

           Which hospital, sir?

                          WAYNE
           Whichever one Jim Gordon's in.

                          FOX
           Actually, you did that yourself.
           See, if you funnel the entire R and
           D budget for five years into a
           fusion project that you then
           mothball, your company is unlikely
           to thrive.

           35.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Even with -

                         

                          FOX
           A wildly sophisticated CEO, yes.
           Wayne Enterprises is running out of
           time. And Daggett is moving in.

                          WAYNE
           What're my options?

                          FOX
           If you're not willing to turn your
           machine on -

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can't, Lucius.

                          FOX
           Then sit tight. Your majority keeps
           Daggett at arm's length while we
           figure out a future for the energy
           program with Miranda Tate - she's
           supported your project all the way.
           She's smart, and quite lovely.

                          WAYNE
           You too, Lucius?

                          FOX
           We all just want what's best for
           you, Bruce. Show her the machine.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'll think it over.

                          FOX
           Anything else?

                         

                          WAYNE
           No, why?

                          FOX
           These conversations always used to
           end with some...unusual requests.

                          WAYNE
           I retired.

                          FOX
           Let me show you some stuff, anyway.
          Fox hits a button - the bookcase opens into a hidden
          elevator.

           36.

                         

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER

          Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They
          pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...

                          WAYNE
           I figured you'd have shut this
           place down.

                          FOX
           It was always shut down,
           officially.

                          WAYNE
           But all this new stuff?

                          FOX
           After your father died, Wayne
           Enterprises set up fourteen
           different defense subsidiaries.
           I've spent years shuttering them
           and consolidating all the
           prototypes under one roof. My roof.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          FOX
           Stop them falling into the wrong
           hands. Besides, I thought someone
           might get some use out of them...
          Wayne shakes his head.

                          FOX
           Sure I can't tempt you to
           something? Pneumatic crampons?
           Infrared lenses? Least let me get
           you something for that leg.

                         

                          WAYNE
           It's fine the use it gets these
           days.

                          FOX
           Well, then I have just the thing
           for an eccentric billionaire who
           doesn't like to walk...
          Fox opens a door - we glimpse a sleek vehicle. Wayne's eyes
          light up.

           37.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Now you're just showing off.

                         

                          FOX
           Defense Department project for
           tight-geometry urban pacification.
           Rotors configured for maneuvering
           between buildings without
           recirculation.

                         

                          WAYNE
           What's it called?

                          FOX
           It has a long and uninteresting
           Wayne Enterprises designation. So I
           took to calling it the Bat. And
           yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come in
           black.
          Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.

                         

                          FOX
           Works great except for the
           autopilot.

                          WAYNE
           What's wrong with that?

                          FOX
           Software-based instability. Take a
           better mind than mine to fix it.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Better mind?

                          FOX
           I was trying to be modest. A less
           busy mind. Yours, perhaps.
          Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

                          WAYNE
           I told you. I retired, Lucius.

                         

                         

          INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.

                         

                          DOCTOR
           I've seen worse cartilage in knees

                          -

           38.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           That's good -

                          DOCTOR
           No, that's because there is no
           cartilage in your knee. And not
           much of any use in your elbows and
           shoulders. Between that and the
           scar tissue on your kidneys,
           residual concussive damage to your
           brain tissue and general
           scarred-over quality of your
           body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
           cannot recommend that you go
           heli-skiing. About the only part of
           your body that looks healthy is
           your liver, so if you're bored I
           recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
           Wayne.
          Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
          steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
          which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
          frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

                         

          EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne drops three floors...

                         

                         

          INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
          mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
          to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

                          GORDON
           We were in this together. Then you
           were gone...

                         

                          WAYNE
           The Batman wasn't needed anymore.
           We won.

                          GORDON
           Built on a lie. Our lie. Now
           there's evil rising from where we
           tried to bury it. Nobody will
           listen... The Batman has to come
           back.

           39.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           What if he doesn't exist anymore?

                          GORDON
           He must. He must.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

          Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
          houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
          dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She
          picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you - money first -

           YUPPIE (O.S.)
           Goddammit, you took my wallet!

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
          her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
          grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

                          SELINA
           Get out.

                         

                          YUPPIE
           She took my wallet!
          Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.

                          SELINA
           Now.
          She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
          Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

                          SELINA
           I told you not to try it with the
           assholes, Jen.

                          JEN
           They're all assholes.

           40.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Okay, the assholes who hit.

                          JEN
           I don't know what he's so upset
           about, he only had sixty bucks in
           here.

                          SELINA
           Probably the watch.

                         

                          YOUNG WOMAN
           Watch?
          Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

          Selina exits and hails a cab. Wayne watches her go. Then
          pulls out. Checking his tracker.

                         

                         

          EXT. MUSEUM, GOTHAM - LATER

          Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.
          Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.
          Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...

                         

                          PAPARAZZI
           Another stiff too old to climb out
           of his sports car.

                          PAPARAZZI 2
           No, that's Bruce Wayne! Hey, Wayne,
           where you been hiding?
          Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob
          - a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm not sure if my assistant put me
           on the guest list -

                          GREETER
           Right through here, Mr. Wayne...

           41.

                         

                         

          INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

          A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling
          confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.
          He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
          wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Bruce Wayne at a charity ball?
          Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her
          only concession to fancy dress.

                          WAYNE
           Miss Tate, isn't it?

                          MIRANDA
           Even before you became a recluse,
           you never came to these things...

                          WAYNE
           True. Proceeds go to the big fat
           spread, not the cause. It's not
           about charity, it's about feeding
           the ego of whichever society hag
           laid it on.

                          MIRANDA
           Actually, this is my party, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           Oh.

                          MIRANDA
           And the proceeds will go where they
           should, because I paid for the big
           fat spread myself.

                          WAYNE
           That's very generous of you.

                          MIRANDA
           You have to invest to restore
           balance to the world. Take our
           clean-energy project...

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sometimes the investment doesn't
           pay off. Sorry.

           42.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You have a practiced apathy, Mr.
           Wayne. But a man who doesn't care
           about the world doesn't spend half
           his fortune on a plan to save it...
           (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
           it fails that he goes into
           hiding...
          Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Have a good evening, Mr. Wayne.
          Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

                          WAYNE
           Mind if I cut in?
          Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
          Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

                          WAYNE
           You don't seem very happy to see
           me.

                          SELINA
           You were supposed to be a shut-in.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Felt like some fresh air.

                          SELINA
           Why didn't you call the police?

                         

                          WAYNE
           I have a powerful friend who deals
           with this kind of thing. (Admires
           her cat ears.) Brazen costume for a
           cat burglar.

                         

                          SELINA
           Yeah? Who are you pretending to be?

                          WAYNE
           Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.
           Who's your date?

                          SELINA
           His wife's in Ibiza. She left her
           diamonds behind, though. Worried
           they'd get stolen.

           43.

                         

                          WAYNE
          It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You
          wouldn't want these folks realizing
          you're a crook not a social
          climber.

                         

                          SELINA
           (flash of anger)
          You think I care what anyone in
          this room thinks about me?

                         

                          WAYNE
          I doubt you care what anyone in
          this room thinks about you.

                          SELINA
          Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
          don't know a thing about me.

                          WAYNE
          Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
          here from your walk-up in Old Town
          - modest place for a master jewel
          thief. Which means either you're
          saving for your retirement - or
          you're in deep with the wrong
          people.

                         

                          SELINA
          You don't get to judge me because
          you were born in the master bedroom
          of Wayne Manor.

                          WAYNE
          Actually, I was born in the Regency
          Room.

                          SELINA
          I started off doing what I had to.
          Once you've done what you had to
          they'll never let you do what you
          want to.

                          WAYNE
          Start fresh.

                         

                          SELINA
          There's no fresh start in today's
          world. Any twelve-year-old with a
          cell phone could find out what you
          did. Everything we do is collated
          and quantified. Everything sticks.
          We are the sum of our mistakes.

           44.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Or our achievements.

                          SELINA
           The mistakes stick better. Trust
           me.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You think that justifies stealing?

                          SELINA
           I take what I need to from those
           who have more than enough. I don't
           stand on the shoulders of people
           with less.

                          WAYNE
           Robin Hood?

                          SELINA
           I'd do more to help someone than
           most of the people in this room.
           Than you.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you're assuming too much.

                          SELINA
           Or maybe you're being unrealistic
           about what's really in your pants
           other than your wallet.

                          WAYNE
           Ouch.

                         

                          SELINA
           You think all this can last?
          Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.

                         

                          SELINA
           There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
           You and your friends better batten
           down the hatches, because when it
           hits you're all gonna wonder how
           you ever thought you could live so
           large and leave so little to the
           rest of us.

                          WAYNE
           Sounds like you're looking forward
           to it.

           45.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           I'm adaptable.

                          WAYNE
           These pearls do look better on you
           then they did in my safe...

                         
          Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
          of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
           But I still can't let you keep
           them.

                         
          The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
          looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears
          into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.

          Wayne approaches the Valet. Pats down his pockets.

          Alfred watches in the mirror as Wayne climbs into the back.

           Just you, sir?

           Don't worry, Master Wayne. Takes a
           little time to get back into the
           swing of things.
          Wayne dials his phone.

           FOX (O.S.)
           This is Fox.

           Remember those 'unusual requests' I
           used to make?

           FOX (O.S.)
           I knew it!
          Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - DAY


                         
          Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace
          strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts
          moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a
          Thermos.

                         

                          ALFRED
           You've got the wrong leg, sir.

                          WAYNE
           You start with the good limb so it
           learns your optimum muscle
           patterns.
          Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it
          - the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.
           Now we tighten it up.

                         
          Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink
          tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.

                          ALFRED
           It is terribly painful?

                          ALFRED
           Happy watching, thank you, sir.
          Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.

           Not bad at all.

                         
          Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows
          Wayne across the bridge to the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Master Wayne, if you're considering
           going back out there you need to
           hear some rumors surrounding Bane.

           I'm all ears.

           There is a prison. In a more

           from the darkness. Sometimes...the
           pit sends something back.

           Bane.

                          ALFRED
           Born and raised in a hell on earth.

           Born in a prison?

           No one knows why. Or how he
           escaped. But they know who trained
           him one he did...R¯'s al Gh¯l. Your

           mentor.

                         
          Wayne takes this in. Shocked.

                          ALFRED
           He plucked Bane from a dark corner
           of the earth and trained him in the
           blackest disciplines of combat,
           deception and endurance. Just like
           you.

                          WAYNE
           Bane was a member of the League of

           That was then. And you can strap up
           your leg and put the mask back on.

           were.

          The Batsuit emerges from the cube.

                          ALFRED
           Yes, this city needs Bruce Wayne.
           Your resources, your
           knowledge...not your body. Not your
           life. That time has passed.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I tried helping as Bruce Wayne,
           Alfred. And I failed.

                          ALFRED
           You can fail as Bruce Wayne. As
           Batman, you can't afford to.

                          WAYNE
           That's what you're afraid of - that
           if I go back out there I'll fail.

          INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

          A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...
          Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.

                         

                          TRADER 2
           You can't short the stock because
           Bruce Wayne goes to a party -

                          TRADER 1
           Wayne coming back is change. Change
           is either good or bad.

                          TRADER 2
           On what basis?

                         

                          TRADER 1
           I flipped a coin.
          Near the front entrance: a Food Delivery Guy is standing
          there negotiating with a Trader.

                         

                          TRADER 3
           No. Rye. I told 'em rye.
          Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.
           Alright, I'll take it.

                         
          He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...
          At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,
          wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his
          face.

                         

           FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
           Rookie! Lose the helmet! (Points at
           a camera.) We need faces for
           cameras.

                         
          In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of
          the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.
          At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the
          man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes
          the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a
          gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide
          home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading
          floor.
          At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.
          The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.

           50.

                         
          In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and
          pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.

                         
          Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol
          - clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man
          moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.
          Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the
          Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,
          lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.
          Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The
          floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,
          screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...

                         

                          TRADER 1
           This is a stock exchange, there's
           no money you can steal -
          He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...

                         

                          BANE
           Why else would you people be here?
          Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the
          floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the
          man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.

                         

                          BANE
           Enter your password. Or I send
           these men to your home.

                         
          Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.
          Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs
          it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

                          (ON TV)
           Police are keeping quiet about the
           prospect of a return by the Batman,
           but eyewitness accounts seem the
           clearly suggests the type of...

          INT. DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

          Daggett watches the TV coverage, concerned. Stryver enters.

                          STRYVER
           Bane says the Batman interfered,
           but the task was accomplished.

                          DAGGETT
           What about the men they arrested?

                         

                          STRYVER
           He says, and I quote, they would
           die before talking.

                          DAGGETT

                          (GRINS)
           Where does he find these guys?
          Daggett gets to his feet, relieved, moves to his inner
          office.
           Open the champagne...

                         

                         

          INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Daggett comes through the door, calling back.

                          DAGGETT
           And can we get some girls in here?

           CATWOMAN (O.S.)
           Careful what you wish for.
          Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back
          slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! -
          Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using
          the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.

                          CATWOMAN
           Cat got your tongue?
          She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.

                          DAGGETT
           You dumb bitch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Nobody ever accused me of being
           dumb.

           60.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           Dumb to show up here tonight.

                          CATWOMAN
           I want what you owe me -

                         
          Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.

                          DAGGETT
           'I want' never gets...

                         
          Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
          leg...

                          STRYVER
           Nice outfit...those heels make it
           tough to walk?

                         
          Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know, do they?

                         
          Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.

                          CATWOMAN
           So where is it?

                          DAGGETT
           Where's what?

                          CATWOMAN
           The program. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          DAGGETT
           Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
           master thief with a record. I don't
           have it.
          The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
          Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
          heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
          window. He screams - they drop...

                         

          EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          ...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
          her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
          the side of the building.

           61.

                         

                         

          EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Where is it?

                         

                          DAGGETT
           The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
           and date of birth and within a
           couple hours that person ceases to
           exist in any database? Little too
           good to be true.

                          CATWOMAN
           You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
           prototype stage -

                         

                          DAGGETT
           That's why I bought them. But they
           had nothing. It was a gangland
           myth.

                         
          Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
          drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
          Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Stay back!
          They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
          onto his gun.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'm not bluffing!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           They know...

                         
          All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

                          BATMAN
           They just don't care.

                         
          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

           62.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           You've got to be kidding.

                          BATMAN
           No guns. No killing.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Where's the fun in that?
          As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
          the far edge.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Come on!
          Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
          She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
          sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
          Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
          gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
          cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           My mother warned me about getting
           into cars with strange men -

                          BATMAN
           This isn't a car.
          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
          the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           See you around -
          Batman steps down after her.

                         

                          BATMAN
           You're welcome.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had it under control.

           63.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Those weren't street thugs - they
           were trained killers. I saved your
           life. In return I need to know what
           you did with Bruce Wayne's
           fingerprints.
          Catwoman looks at him. Considering.

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne wasn't kidding about a
           'powerful friend'. I sold his
           prints to Daggett. For something
           that doesn't even exist.

                          BATMAN
           I doubt many people get the better
           of you.

                          CATWOMAN
           Hey, when a girl's desperate...

                         

                          BATMAN
           What were they going to do with
           them?

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know. But Daggett seemed
           pretty interested in that mess at
           the stock market.
          Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
          searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Miss Kyle -?
          But she is gone.
           So that's what that feels like.

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

          Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
          at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
          brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
          water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
          Alfred brushes water off his suit.

                          ALFRED
           Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell

           be together. That was my life
           beyond this cave and I can't just
           move on. She didn't. She couldn't.

                         
          Alfred considers this. Looks away.

                          ALFRED
           What if he had? What if she wasn't
           intending to make a life with you?

           67.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           She was, I can't change that -

                          ALFRED
           What if, before she died, she'd
           written a letter? Explaining that
           she'd chosen Harvey Dent over you?
          Wayne watches, confused, as the old man prepares to say -

                          ALFRED
           And what if, to spare you
           pain...I'd burned that letter?
          Wayne stares at Alfred, shocked.

                          WAYNE
           Why would you say such a thing?

                          ALFRED
           Because I have to make you
           understand.

                         

                          WAYNE
           You're lying.

                          ALFRED
           Because you are as precious to me
           as you were to your own mother and
           father and I swore to them that I
           would protect you and I haven't.

                          WAYNE
           You're lying!

                         

                          ALFRED
           I've never lied to you. Except when
           I burned Rachel's letter.
          Wayne turns on the old man, furious.

                         

                          WAYNE
           How dare you use Rachel to stop me!

                          ALFRED
           I'm using the truth, Master Wayne.
           Maybe it's time we all stopped
           trying to outsmart the truth and
           just let it have its day. I'm
           sorry.

           68.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Sorry?! You expect to destroy my
           world, then shake hands?!

                          ALFRED
           No. I know what this means -

                          WAYNE
           What does it mean, Alfred?!

                          ALFRED
           It means your hatred. It means
           losing the person I've cared for
           ever since I heard his first cries
           echo through this house. But it
           might also mean saving your life.
           And that is more important.

                         
          Wayne looks at Alfred. Furious. Summons the worst thing to
          say and says it quietly and calmly.

                          WAYNE
           Goodbye, Alfred.

                         

                          ALFRED

                          (QUIET)
           Goodbye, Bruce.
          Wayne mounts the stairs...Alfred watches him go. Turns.

                         

                         

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

          Wayne is woken by the doorbell.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRCASE, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

          As Wayne moves through the empty house, tying his dressing
          gown, he can't resist one tentative.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Alfred?
          But Alfred is gone.

                         

                         

          INT. FRONT HALL, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne opens the front door the find Fox. Fox is surprised.

           69.

                         

                         

                          FOX
           Answering your own door?

                          WAYNE
           Yes. Could you decode the trades on
           that drive?

                         
          Fox hands Wayne a newspaper - the main headline:

          BATMAN BACK TO FOIL OR MASTERMIND STOCK RAID...

                         

                          FOX
           I didn't need to. Page three.
          Wayne turns the page:

          WAYNE DOUBLES DOWN - AND LOSES...

                         

                          FOX
           It seems you made a series of large
           put options on the futures
           exchange. Verified by thumb print.
           The options expired at midnight
           last night.
          Wayne looks up from the newspaper, reeling.

                          FOX
           Long term we may be able to prove
           fraud, but for now...you're
           completely broke. And Wayne
           Enterprises is about to fall into
           the hands of John Daggett.

                          WAYNE
           The weapons - we can't let Daggett
           get his hands on Applied Sciences -

                          FOX
           Applied Sciences is shut up tight,
           and off the books. The energy
           project is a different story.

                          WAYNE
           Miranda Tate. We need to convince
           the board to get behind her. Let's
           show her the reactor -

                          FOX
           We're meeting her there in
           thirty-five minutes. You better get
           dressed.

           70.

                         

          EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES RECYCLING PLANT - DAY

          A scrapyard on the Gotham river. Across the water, the
          towers of Gotham. Lucius leads Miranda from her car.

                          MIRANDA
           You brought me out here to show me
           a rubbish dump, Mr. Fox?

                         

                          FOX
           Bear with me, Miss Tate.
          They arrive at a Portakabin and enter.

                         

                         

          INT. PORTAKABIN - CONTINUOUS

          Miranda looks around the derelict office. Fox smiles at her.

                          FOX
           Keep your hands and feet inside the
           car at all times.
          He hits a button and the floor descends, Miranda is shocked
          as the office becomes an elevator into -

                         

                         

          INT. ELEVATOR, FUSION REACTOR - CONTINUOUS

          They descend diagonally into a massive concrete tunnel...

                          MIRANDA
           This is it, isn't it?

                         

                          FOX
           The reactor is beneath the river so
           that it could be instantly flooded
           in an event of a security breach.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Is Bruce Wayne really that
           paranoid?

                          FOX
           I'm gonna plead the fifth on that
           one.
          Miranda marvels as they step off the elevator. She spots a
          figure deep within: Bruce Wayne.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I thought you might like to see
           what your investment built.

           71.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           No radiation, no fossil fuels.
           Free, clean energy for an entire
           city.

                          WAYNE
           If it worked. It doesn't.
          Wayne leads Miranda to the core. Two perpendicular rings of
          electromagnets suspend a bowling-ball-sized mass of metal.
          Wayne hits buttons - the ball glows, then dies to cold.

                          WAYNE
           Ignition, yes. But no chain
           reaction.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           You've built a lot of security
           around a damp squib.
          Nothing.
           About three years ago a Russian
           scientist published a paper on
           weaponized fusion reactions. One
           week later your reactor started
           developing problems... (Looks at
           Wayne.) I think this machine works.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Miranda, if it were operational,
           the danger to Gotham would be too
           great.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Would it make you feel better to
           know that the Russian scientist
           died in a plane crash six months
           ago?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Someone else will work out what Dr.
           Pavel did. Someone else will figure
           out how to turn this power source
           into a nuclear weapon. I need you
           to take control of Wayne
           Enterprises and this reactor.

                          MIRANDA
           And to do what with it?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Nothing. Until we can find a way to
           guarantee its safety.

           72.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And if we can't?

                         

                          WAYNE
           Decommission it. Flood it.

                          MIRANDA
           Destroy the world's best chance for
           a sustainable future?

                         

                          WAYNE
           If the world's not ready. Yes.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce, if you want to save the
           world you have to start trusting
           it.

                          WAYNE
           I'm trusting you.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Doesn't count. You have no choice.

                          WAYNE
           I could've flooded this chamber any
           time in the last three years. I'm
           choosing to trust you, Miranda, and
           that's not the easiest thing for
           me. Please.
          His eyes are genuine. Pleading. Miranda nods.

                         

                          FOX

          The Board Members, including Daggett and Miranda, take their
          seats. Fox at one end of the table, Wayne at the other.

                          DAGGETT
           I'd like to point out that we have
           a non-board member here. Highly
           irregular, even if it is his family
           name above the door...
          All eyes go to Wayne. An older member of the board pipes up.

           disagree? Check the value of your

                          FOX
           I'm afraid he has a point, Mr.

                          WAYNE
           I understand. Ladies and gentlemen.

                         
          Wayne glances at Miranda who nods at him. Wayne leaves.

                          DAGGETT
           Let's get down to business.

          INT. LOBBY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Wayne exits the building. There is an angry mob of
          Shareholders and a pack of hungry Reporters.

                          REPORTER
           Wayne, how's it feel to be one of

          Wayne looks over to see his Lamborghini being towed.

           BLAKE (O.S.)
           Looks like you need a lift.
          Wayne turns to see Blake standing by his patrol car. Nods.

          Daggett bursts in, furious. Stryver tries to placate him.

                          DAGGETT
           How the hell did Miranda Tate get
           the inside track on the Wayne
           board?! Was she meeting with Wayne?
           Was she sleeping with Wayne?

                          STRYVER
           Not that we know of -

                          DAGGETT
           Clearly you don't 'know of'
           anything, do you?! Where's Bane?!

                         

                          STRYVER
           We told him it was urgent -

                          DAGGETT
           Then where is the masked -

                         

           BANE (O.S.)
           Speak of the devil...
          Daggett turns. Bane is already there.

                          BANE
           ...and he shall appear.

                          DAGGETT
           What the hell's going on?

                          BANE
           The plan is proceeding as expected.

                          DAGGETT
           You see me running Wayne
           Enterprises?! (Moves towards Bane.)
           Your stock exchange hit didn't
           work, friend. And now you've got my
           construction crews working all
           hours around the city? How's that
           supposed to help my company absorb
           Wayne's?

                         

                          BANE

                          (TO STRYVER)
           Leave us.

           75.

                         

                         

                          DAGGETT
           You stay right there! I'm in
           charge!
          Bane places a gentle hand on Daggett's shoulder.

                         

                          BANE
           Do you feel in charge?
          Daggett is taken aback. Stryver leaves.

                         

                          DAGGETT
           I've paid you a small fortune -

                          BANE
           And that gives you power over me?

                         
          Daggett considers the heavy hand on his shoulder. Nervous.

                          DAGGETT
           What is this?

                          BANE
           Your money and infrastructure have
           been important. Till now.

                          DAGGETT
           What are you?

                         

                          BANE
           Gotham's reckoning. Come to end the
           borrowed time you've all been
           living on...

                         
          Bane gently takes the terrified Daggett's head in his
          hands...

                          DAGGETT
           You are true evil...

                         

                          BANE
           I am necessary evil.
          Stryver, on the steps outside the living room, flinches.

                         

                         

                         SCENE OMITTED

           76.

                         

                         

          INT./EXT. CRUISER ON GOTHAM STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne stares out the window. Blake glances across.

                          BLAKE
           When you began...why the mask?

                         

                          WAYNE
           To protect the people closest to
           me.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You're a loner with no family.

                          WAYNE
           There are always people you care
           about. You just don't realize how
           much until they're gone. (Collects
           himself.) The idea was to be a
           symbol. Batman could be anybody,
           that was the point.

                          BLAKE
           It was damn good to see him back.

                          WAYNE
           Not everybody agrees.

                          BLAKE
           They'll figure it out in the end.

                          WAYNE
           Got anything on Bane's whereabouts?

                          BLAKE
           Yeah, I've got five hundred pages
           of tunnel records and a flashlight.
           I could use some help.

                          WAYNE

                          (THINKS)
           You know what? Drop me in Old
           Town...

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY


                         
          Blake drops Wayne off.

                          WAYNE
           Don't wait. I'll get a cab.

           77.

                         

                          BLAKE
           You got money?

                         

                          WAYNE
           (smiles, sheepish)
           Actually, no.
          Blake hands him some bills, watches him cross the street.
          The radio squawks. Blake reacts - drives off.

                         

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina is packing a bag. She hears voices in the stairwell.

                         

           JEN (O.S.)
           I told you, money first.

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't think so.

                         

                         

          INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          Selina finds Wayne standing there with Jen.

                          SELINA
           He's not a mark.
          Jen looks at Selina. At Wayne.

                          SELINA
           And he doesn't have a cent to his
           name, anyway.

                         

          INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne looks at the cramped space. Selina shifts,
          embarrassed.

                          SELINA
           Yeah, it's not much. (Smiles.) But
           it's more that you've got right
           now.

                          WAYNE
           Actually, they're letting me keep
           the house.

                         

                          SELINA

                          (SHAKES HEAD)
           The rich don't even go broke same
           as the rest of us, huh?

           78.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           (spots her bag)
           Vacation?

                          SELINA
           Let's just say that I've incurred
           the wrath of some people less
           susceptible to my charms than you.

                          WAYNE
           My powerful friend hopes to change
           your mind about leaving.

                          SELINA
           And how would he do that?

                          WAYNE
           By giving you what you want.

                          SELINA
           It doesn't exist.

                          WAYNE
           He says it does. He wants to meet.
           Tonight.

                          SELINA
           Why?

                         

                          WAYNE
           He needs to find Bane. He thinks
           you'd know how.

                          SELINA
           Tell him I'll think about it.
          Wayne nods, starts to leave.

                          SELINA
           Mr. Wayne? I'm sorry they took all
           your money.

                          WAYNE
           No, you're not.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

          Blake moves through the hospital corridor, looking for -

           79.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Blake enters. Gordon is sitting up in bed, talking to Foley.

                          FOLEY
           Can we help you, officer?

                          BLAKE
           John Daggett's body was found in a
           dumpster an hour ago. I thought you
           might like to know.

                         

                          GORDON
           Why?

                          BLAKE
           Because Daggett's name is all over
           the permits I pulled to map the
           tunnels under Gotham.
          Blake hands Gordon a stack of files. Foley glares at Blake.

                         

                          BLAKE
           MTA maintenance, sewer
           construction...

                          GORDON

                          (TO FOLEY)
           Where did you get to with the
           tunnel searches?

                          FOLEY

                          (TO BLAKE)
           Remind me to tell the detail to
           keep hotheads out. (To Gordon.)
           We've had teams down there, but
           it's a huge network -

                          GORDON
           Get more men, work a grid. I want
           him found.

                          FOLEY
           Yeah, yeah - the masked man. We're
           on it.

                         
          Gordon eyes the files hungrily - glances up at Blake.

                          GORDON
           This is good work. Lose the uniform
           - you're working for me now. We
           could use some hotter heads around
           here.

           80.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           This could just be a coincidence.

                          GORDON
           You're a detective now, son, you're
           not allowed to believe in
           coincidence anymore.
          Blake tries to conceal his excitement from Foley.

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - EVENING (END OF DAY)

          Wayne, covering his head with a newspaper, hurries up the
          driveway in the rain. Steps into the alcove. Hits the bell.

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           Nobody's answering.
          Wayne turns to find Miranda there.

                          WAYNE
           No. I'm on my own now.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Do you have keys?
          Wayne looks a little helpless all of a sudden.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Never needed them...
          She takes his hand.

                          MIRANDA
           Let's find a window.

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS (END OF DAY)

          They force the French windows - enter, brushing off the
          rain.

                          MIRANDA
           Fox worked the board like you've
           never seen - I'm in, Daggett's out
           and he's not happy.
          Wayne sets down the newspaper:

          FROM BILLIONAIRE TO BUM

           81.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Hope you don't like me for your
           money.
          Miranda kicks off her shoes. Glances at the paper.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Suffering builds character.
          Then at a photo of Wayne's parents.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           I'll take care of your parents'
           legacy, Bruce.
          Miranda picks up a photo of Rachel.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Who's this?
          Wayne looks at her. Can't find words...

                          MIRANDA
           Where's Alfred?

                          WAYNE
           He left. Taking everything.
          Miranda puts the photo down. Kisses him. Passionately. Then
          again. He kisses back. Suddenly the lights go out.

                          MIRANDA
           What's that?

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SHEEPISH)
           I think my power's been shut off.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER (NIGHT)


                         
          Wayne watches as Miranda tends to a roaring fire.

                          WAYNE
           You're pretty good at that.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           When I was a child we had almost
           nothing. But on the nights we had a
           fire, we felt very rich indeed.
          She returns to him, pulling a blanket around both of them.

           82.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I assumed your family was wealthy.

                          MIRANDA
           Not always. Not when I was young.

                         
          He traces a scar on her shoulder.

                          MIRANDA
           An old mistake.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I've made a few myself.
          She turns to him, tracing the scars across his chest.

                          MIRANDA
           More than a few... (Smiles.) We
           could leave. Tonight. Take my
           plane. Go anywhere we wanted.

                          WAYNE
           Someday perhaps. Not tonight.
          She pulls him close. He kisses her. They fold into each
          other, the warm heart at the center of a vast, cold room.

                         

                         

          INT. GREAT ROOM, WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

          Miranda is sleeping, wrapped in the blanket. Wayne studies
          her for a moment, then slips out...

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Wayne moves to the Batsuit. Picks up the cowl.

                         

          EXT. SKIES ABOVE GOTHAM - NIGHT


                         
          The Bat roars towards downtown. Batman kills the lights and
          main engines - the Bat quietly autorotates into the canyons.

                         

          INT. MIA TUNNEL - LATER


                         
          Catwoman on a wall, watching trains go by. She senses...

                          CATWOMAN
           Don't be shy.

                         
          ...Batman is there.

           83.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne says you can get me the
           'Clean Slate'.

                          BATMAN
           That depends.

                          CATWOMAN
           On what?

                          BATMAN
           On what you want it for. I acquired
           it to keep it out of the wrong
           hands.

                          CATWOMAN
           Still don't trust me, huh? How can
           we change that?

                          BATMAN
           Start by taking me to Bane.

                          CATWOMAN

                          (SHRUGS)
           You asked.
          Catwoman jumps down. Batman follows. Catwoman leads him down
          into a service tunnel...

                         

                         

          INT. SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman speaks over her shoulder as she walks.

                          CATWOMAN
           From here, Bane's men patrol the
           tunnels...and they are not your
           average brawlers.

                          BATMAN
           Neither am I.
          Catwoman swings into a -

                         

          INT. SEWER TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          A Mercenary patrols. Catwoman comes up behind.

                          CATWOMAN
           He's behind you.

           84.

                         

                         

                          MERCENARY

                          (SPINS)
           Who?
          Batman hangs upside down behind him.

                         

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Me.
          Darkness smashes onto the Mercenary. Gunfire in the tunnel.
          Catwoman races along, pursued by a Mercenary. He is yanked
          off his feet by darkness - he screams...
          Batman picks off more and more Mercenaries. Screams echo...
          Batman follows Catwoman through the dark tunnel.

                          CATWOMAN
           Just a little further.
          A grate slams down, separating them - the lights come on. He
          is deep inside.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Mercenaries look down on him from above. Catwoman turns.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had to find a way to stop them
           trying to kill me.

                          BATMAN
           You've made a serious mistake.

           BANE (O.S.)
           Not as serious as yours, I fear.
          Batman turns. Bane emerges from behind the waterfalls.

                          BATMAN
           Bane.

                          BANE
           Let's not stand on ceremony here,
           Mr. Wayne.

                         
          Catwoman hears the name. Less sure of what she's done.
          Batman moves at Bane - strikes powerful blows - Bane catches
          his fist.

                          BANE
           Peace has cost you strength.
           Victory has defeated you.

           85.

                         

                         
          Bane SMASHES Batman back - kicks him off the catwalk -
          Batman drops, uses his cape to land. Bane climbs down on a
          chain - his men watch in disciplined silence - Batman hurls
          flashbangs at Bane, who doesn't flinch.

                         

                          BANE
           Theatricality and deception are
           powerful agents...to the
           uninitiated.
          Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.

                         

                          BANE
           But we are initiated, aren't we,
           Bruce? The League of Shadows. And
           you betrayed us...

                         

                          BATMAN
           Us? You were excommunicated. From a
           gang of psychopaths.

                          BANE
           Now I am the League of Shadows,
           here to fulfill R¯'s al Gh¯l's

                          A U
           destiny...
          Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the
          waterfall, where he smashes his fists and gauntlets into
          Bane's mask again and again, water cascading over them.

                         
          Bane is not moving. Just taking the blows. Batman pauses.
          Bane's arms SHOOT OUT, SMASHING Batman aside - Bane RISES...

                          BANE
           You fight like a younger man.
           Nothing held back. No reserves.
           Admirable. But mistaken.
          Batman hits a switch on his belt - the lights go out - Bane
          turns slowly addressing all the shadows at once.

                         

                          BANE
           You think darkness is your ally.
           But you merely adopted the dark. I
           was born in it. Formed by it...

                         
          In the shadows, Batman circles, looking to strike...

                          BANE
           I didn't see the light until I was
           already a man. And by then it was
           nothing to me but blinding...

           86.

                         

                         
          Bane lunges backwards into the darkness - Batman's throat in
          his grasp.

                          BANE
           The shadows betray you, because
           they belong to me...

                         
          Bane SMASHES him into the ground, POUNDING, pounding,
          pounding the hard cowl with his bare fists until it CRACKS.
          Bane RISES from Batman, gestures to the ceiling of the
          chamber - explosive charges have been drilled into holes...

                          BANE
           I will show you where I've made my
           home while preparing to bring
           justice. Then...I will break you.

                         
          A Mercenary tosses Bane a detonator - Batman watches through
          cracked cowl - Bane hits the detonator - explosions BURST
          over his head as the ceiling CRUMBLES revealing:
          Applied Sciences - Bane has dropped the bottom out of Fox's
          weapons store...a camouflage Tumbler rests in the rubble.

                          BATMAN
           No...

                          BANE
           Your precious armory. Gratefully
           accepted. We will need it.

                         

          INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Mercenaries race through the stacks of equipment...

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman climbs to his feet, swaying. Bane approaches.

                         

                          BANE
           I wondered which would break first
           - your spirit...

                         
          Batman SWINGS at him - misses - Bane GRABS him, lifts him

          HIGH.
           ...or your body.
          Bane brings Batman down onto his knee, BREAKING his back
          with a horrific CRACK.

           87.

                         

                         
          In the shadows, Catwoman looks on. Shocked. Bane crouches to
          pull the broken cowl off the broken Wayne. Mercenaries lift
          Wayne's body and carry him off... Bane stares into the
          hollow eyes of his trophy...

                         
          Catwoman slinks back into the shadows, and we -

           FADE TO BLACK.

                          FADE IN:

                         

                         

          EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Blake's cruiser pulls up. He noses up to the windows.
          Nothing.

                         

                         

          EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - DAY

          Blake sits in his cruiser. Selina exits, wide-brimmed hat,
          bags. Blake recognizes her. She hails a cab.

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (INTO RADIO)
           Get Commissioner Gordon. Tell him
           I've got a line on the
           Congressman's kidnapping.

                         
          Blake pulls out to follow.

                         

          INT. TERMINAL, GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina moves through the terminal. She clocks a Uniform Cop
          staring at her - ducks down a service hallway.

                         

          INT. SERVICE HALLWAY, AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

          The Uniform rounds the corner to find Selina applying
          make-up.

                          UNIFORM
           Excuse me, Miss. I need to see your
           ticket and identification, please.

                         
          Selina, surprised, fumbles with her purse.

                          SELINA
           Would you mind?

           88.

                         

                         
          She hands the Uniform her hat - punches him through the
          brim, stuffs him in a closet - plants her mangled hat on his
          head.

                         

                         

          INT. JETWAY, AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

          Selina makes her way down the jetway - spots Security at the
          far end - turns - Blake smiles at her. Badge in hand.

                         

                         

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, AIRPORT - DAY

          Selina, now in cuffs, looks up as Blake walks in.

                          BLAKE
           I showed your picture to the
           Congressman and guess what?

                          SELINA
           Don't tell me, still in love?

                          BLAKE
           Head over heels. Pressing charges,
           though.
          Blake lays a police file down with a thump.
           You've made some mistakes, Ms.
           Kyle.

                         

                          SELINA
           Girl's gonna eat.

                          BLAKE
           You have an appetite. Why run? You
           can't hide from us with this
           record.

                          SELINA
           Maybe it's not you I'm running
           from.

                          BLAKE
           Who then? Bane? What do you know
           about him?

                         

                          SELINA

                          (QUIET)
           That you should be as afraid of him
           as I am.

           89.

                         

                         

                          BLAKE
           We can offer you protection...
          Selina looks at him with contempt. Blake shrugs, switches
          off the tape, moves to the door.

                         

                          BLAKE
           When I spotted you, I was looking
           for a friend...Bruce Wayne.
          Selina turns to look at Blake. His eyes plead with her.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Did they kill him?

                          SELINA
           I'm not sure.

                         
          And we -

                          CUT TO:
          BLACK SCREEN. Sounds: screaming, laughing, CRYING. Sights:
          LIGHT, bodies FALLING, a DARK SKULL... And we are -

                         

          INT. STONE CELL - DAWN

          Wayne opens his eyes. Unshaven. Filthy. Someone else is in
          the cell - Wayne cannot move to look - even the attempt is
          painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting
          at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.

                          WAYNE
           Why didn't you just kill me?

                         

                          BANE
           You don't fear death. You welcome
           it. Your punishment is to be more
           severe.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (SCATHING)
           You're a torturer...

                          BANE
           Yes. But not of your body. Of your
           soul.
          Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.

           90.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Where am I?

                          BANE
           Home.

                         
          Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
          sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
           Where I learned the truth about
           despair. As will you. (Rises.)
           There is a reason that this prison
           is the worst hell on earth...
          Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
          hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
          well...
           Hope. Every man who has rotted here
           over the centuries has looked up to
           the light and imagined climbing to
           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
           like shipwrecked men turning to sea
           water from uncontrollable thirst,
           many have died trying. I learned
           that there can be no true despair
           without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
           its people hope to poison their
           souls. I will let them believe they
           can survive so that you can watch
           them clamber over each other to
           stay in the sun...
          Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
           You will watch as I torture an
           entire city to cause you pain you
           thought you could never feel again.
           Then, when you have truly
           understood the depths of your
           failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l's destiny. We will destroy

                          U
           Gotham. And when it is done...when
           Gotham is ashes...then you have my
           permission to die.
          Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

                         

                         

          EXT. BLACKGATE PRISON - DAY

          A van pulls through the gate. Selina, inside the van, looks
          up at the formidable grey building.

           91.

                         

          INT. BLACKGATE PRISON - CONTINUOUS

          Guards lead Selina down the cells. Whistles and catcalls.

                         

                          GUARD

           correctional she was sixteen.
          Selina passes a Huge Inmate who strains through the bars...

                         

                          HUGE INMATE
           Little closer, baby...

                          SELINA
           Why, honey, you wanna hold my hand?

                         
          Without breaking step, she slips his outstretched hands
          between her handcuffed ones and cartwheels, snapping his
          arms - he screams in agony - she keeps walking...

                          WARDEN
           She'll be just fine.

                         

                         

          INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - DAY

          Fox comes out of the elevator with Miranda.

                         

                          FOX
           I don't see the need for a board
           meeting on the energy project -

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce got a lot of things right.
           Keeping the board in the dark
           wasn't one of them...
          Fox swings the doors to the boardroom open...

                         

                         

          INT. BOARDROOM, WAYNE ENTERPRISES - CONTINUOUS

          The board is there. Scared. At the head of the table - Bane.

                          BANE
           This meeting is called to order.
          Fox and Miranda freeze. Staring at the mask.

           92.

                         

                         

                          BANE
           Chair and President. I also need
           one ordinary member - Mr. Fox,
           would you care to nominate?

                         

                          FREDERICKS
           No. I volunteer.
          The dignified older board member gets to his feet.
          Mercernaries round the three up.

                         

                          FOX
           Where are you taking us?

                          BANE
           Where you buried your resources.
           The bowels of Gotham.

                         

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

          Gordon, with a Nurse's help, pulls himself to a seated
          position as Blake watches.

                         

                          GORDON
           So you think our friend is gone
           again?

                          BLAKE

                          (GRAVE)
           This time...he might not be coming
           back.
          Gordon takes this in...Foley bursts in, agitated.

                         

                          FOLEY
           Okay, Commissioner, you were right.

                          GORDON
           What's happened?

                         

                          FOLEY
           Your masked man kidnapped the Wayne
           Enterprises board. He let most of
           them go, but took three down into
           the sewers.

                         

                          GORDON
           No more patrols, no more hide and
           seek. Send every available cop
           down there to smoke him out.

           93.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           The Mayor won't want panic -

                          BLAKE
           So it's a training exercise.

                         
          Foley looks at Gordon.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry for not taking you

                          SERIOUSLY -

                         

                          GORDON
           Don't apologize for believing the
           world's in better shape then it
           is...just fight to make it true.

                         
          Foley nods. Leaves. Blake gets up.

                          GORDON
           Not you. You're telling me the
           Batman's gone. So you chase up the
           Daggett leads, any way you can.

                         
          Blake nods.

                         

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his
          parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the
          wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He asks if you would pay us to let
           you die. I told him you have
           nothing.

                          WAYNE
           Do it for the pleasure.

                         
          The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.

                          PRISONER
           They pay me more than that to keep
           you alive.

                         
          A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully
          to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong
          Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other
          Prisoners.

           94.

                         

                         

                          PRISONER
           He will try the climb.
          Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant
          grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.

                         
          Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot
          leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as
          Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he
          swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong
          Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Has anyone made it?

                          PRISONER
           Of course not.

                         
          The Blind Prisoner barks at him.

                          WAYNE
           What does he say?

                         

                          PRISONER
           He says there is one who did. A
           child...
          INSERT CUT: a child of about ten looks up towards the light.

                         

                          PRISONER
           A child who had been born in this
           hell...

                          WAYNE
           Bane.

                         

                          PRISONER
           An old legend. Nothing more.
          The Prisoner leaves Wayne's cell - switches on the TV.

                         

                          WAYNE
           Don't.

                          PRISONER
           Whatever they want you to
           see...it's happening soon.

           95.

                         

                         

          INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - DAY

          Bane's men lead Fox, Miranda and Fredericks through the
          debris. Fox stares at Mercenaries working on his old
          inventions...

                         

                         

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - EVENING

          SWATs and Cops mass around entrances to sewers, tunnels...

                         

                         

          INT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane leads Fox and the others to where Mercenaries plant
          charges on a hewn wall. Dr. Pavel is here. Waiting. Bane
          nods at his men. The wall blows.

                         

                         

          EXT. LOCATIONS AROUND GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

          A SWAT team about to enter a sewer pipe hear a low echoing
          boom. They look at each other, then head in. Thousands of
          Police head into manholes, tunnel entrances, checking
          weapons, using flashlights...

                         

          INT. MASSIVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane leads the way over rubble into the REACTOR. Dr. Pavel
          follows. Bane approaches the machine. Turns to Fox.

                          BANE
           Turn it on.

                         
          Fox shakes his head. Bane holds his gun to Fredericks' head.

                          BANE
           I only need one other board member.
           There are eight more waiting
           upstairs.

                         

                          FOX
           I won't do it.
          Fredericks trembles. Bane cocks the weapon.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Alright, stop.
          She walks up to the scanner. Places her hand on it. It
          beeps. She turns to Fox. Quietly pleading.

           96.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           Lucius, you'll kill this man and
           yourself, and barely slow them
           down.
          Fox reluctantly puts his hand on the scanner. Then
          Fredericks. The core glows brighter and brighter. Dr. Pavel
          is transfixed.

                         

                          BANE
           Do your work.
          Bane turns to his men. Gestures at the hostages.
           Take them to the surface. People of
           their status deserve to see the
           next era of western civilization.
          Fox, Miranda and Fredericks are led back into the rubble.

                          REPORTER
           We're seeing literally thousands of
           police heading into the sewers -

                          MAYOR
           A training exercise, that's all. If
           you'll excuse me, I've got tickets
           to watch our boys thrash Rapid
           City.
          The Mayor heads into the stadium with the crowds...

                         

                         

          INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

           I've been to half Daggett's cement
           plants, logged locations they've
           poured for underground
           construction...

           GORDON (O.S.)
           Anything strange about the
           pourings?
          Blake glances at a large map - dots mark pouring locations.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Honestly, Commissioner, I don't
           know anything about civil
           engineering.

                         

                          GORDON
           But you know about patterns. Keep
           looking.
          Blake pulls up in front of a cement plant.

           It's done. This is now a
           four-megaton nuclear bomb.

           (to his men)
           Pull the core out of the reactor.

                         

           DR. PAVEL

                          (HORRIFIED)
           You can't. This is the only power
           source capable of sustaning it - if
           you move it, the core will decay in
           a matter of months.

                          BANE
           Five, by my calculations.

                         

           DR. PAVEL
           And then it will go off.

                          BANE
           For the sake of your family, Dr.
           Pavel, I hope so.

                         
          Dr. Pavel stares as Mercenaries start to disconnect the
          core...

          Blake is led through a fence by a Worker.

                         

                          WORKER
           Boss is about to leave.
          Blake walks past cement mixers. Spots someone. A Driver.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Hey.
          The Driver turns.

                          BLAKE
           That was you outside the stock
           exchange, right?

                          DRIVER
           When?

                         

                          BLAKE
           When? When half the city's cops
           were trying to pull onto Castle
           Street and your truck shut them
           out.

                         

                          DRIVER
           Oh yeah. You're that cop -

                          BLAKE
           Detective, now.

                         
          Behind Blake the Worker puts his hand is his pocket...

                          BLAKE
           And as a detective...I'm not
           allowed to believe in coincidences

                          ANYMORE -
          Blake spins, drawing his weapon. The Worker lunges with a
          knife, Blake smashes his hand to one side and shoots him.
          The Driver grabs him from behind. Blake wrestles, but the
          Driver is strong, trained. Blake can't aim his gun, he fires
          behind, into a steel mixer - the bullets ricochet, one
          catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,
          gasping, kneels beside the Driver.

                          BLAKE
           What were you doing?! What?!

                         
          The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses
          is down. Pulls out his phone. Dials.

           fell to his death in the struggle
           over my son's life. The Batman did

           These men, locked up in Blackgate
           for eight years, denied parole
           under the Dent Act. Based on a lie.

                          GORDON
           A lie to keep a city from burning
           to the ground. Gotham needed a

           Not as much as it does now. But you
           betrayed everything you stood for.

           (looks at Blake)
           There's a point. Far out there.
           When the structures fail you. When
           the rules aren't weapons anymore,
           they're shackles, letting the bad

           have such a moment of crisis. And
           in that moment, I hope you have a

          upright. The Prisoner ties him off. Checks his spine.

          gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the

          get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.

          next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.
          His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -
          the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The
          Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner

           Because, Captain, we built it.

           As the device's fuel cells decay,
           it's becoming increasingly

          Captain Jones reels at this news.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Bane's revolution is a sham. He's
           watching Gotham rearrange its
           deckchairs while the whole ship's
           going down. Your appeasement plan
           might not be as practical as you
           thought.
          Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           Could you disarm it?

                          FOX
           I don't know, But I could reconnect
           it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           We'd have to let the Pentagon know.

           We have no choice. Let's move away
           from this location, then call it
           in.

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - MOMENTS LATER

          Captain Jones exits the elevator, followed by his men and
          Blake. Halfway across the floor, hell breaks loose.
          Mercenaries blast them with machine guns - the lobby becomes
          a devastating ambush. Blake dives back into the elevator.

          Blake flies out of the elevator.

           Fox, somebody sold us out!
          Fox and Miranda burst into the corridor.

           Take Miranda -
          Blake grabs Miranda, heads for the back stairs. Mercenaries
          jump out of the elevator, firing high.

                         

                          MERCERNARY

          Fox freezes. Lowers himself to the ground.

                         

                         

          INT. TELLSONS BANK - CONTINUOUS

          Captain Jones goes down in a hail of bullets. The other
          Special Forces Men are down. Bane enters, midges Jones with
          his toe. He is alive. Barely. Bane leans in close. Jones
          looks up at him, defiant.

                         

                          CAPTAIN JONES
           I'll die before I talk...

                          BANE
           I'm on your schedule, Captain.

                         
          Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.

                          MERCERNARY
           There were people living upstairs.

                         
          Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.

          INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

          Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in
          the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the
          screen.

                         

          INT. SAME - LATER


                         
          Wayne does endless push-ups, squats, stretches. The Blind
          Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.

                          PRISONER
           He says the leap to freedom is not
           about strength.

           My body makes the jump.

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           Survival is the spirit. The soul.

                          WAYNE
           My soul's as ready to escape as my
           body.

                         

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Fear is why you fail.

                          WAYNE
           I'm not afraid. I'm angry.

                         
          Wayne throws punches...focused.

                         

          INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY


                         
          Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners
          look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts
          climbing, determined.
          He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -
          it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock
          face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.
          A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up
          at Wayne, hanging upside down.

                          SKINNY PRISONER
           Shouldn't you get him down?
          The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.

           126.

           He'll keep.

          INT. CAVE PRISON - NIGHT

          Wayne wakes with a start - the Blind Prisoner is there.

                          BLIND PRISONER

                          (CRACKED ENGLISH)
           You do not fear death. You think
           this makes you strong. This makes
           you weak.

                          WAYNE
           Why?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           How can you move faster then
           possible? Fight longer than
           possible? If not from the most
           powerful impulse of the spirit. The
           fear of death. The will to survive.
          Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.

                          WAYNE
           I do fear death. I fear dying in
           here while my city burns with no
           one there to save it.

                          BLIND PRISONER
           Then make the climb.

                          WAYNE
           How?

                          BLIND PRISONER
           As the child did. Without the rope.
           (Dry laugh.) Then fear will find
           you again.
          Wayne considers this.

           127.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

          Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
          folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

                          PRISONER
           Supplies for your journey?
          Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
          Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
          Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
          to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
          makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
          below the Prisoners start a low chant.
          As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
          EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
          circle up to the opening above...
          Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
          breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
          again...then he jumps.

                         
          Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
          And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
          The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
          ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

          Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.
          He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached
          to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

          A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,
          industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down
          into the chamber, pull out a man, who starts yelling. It is
          Stryver, Daggett's functionary.

                          STRYVER
           I want to see Bane! There's been a
           mistake! Take me to Bane!
          Fox watches him dragged upstairs...

          A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.

           There's been a mistake! Where's
           Bane?!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           There's been no mistake, Mr.
           Stryver.

                         
          Stryver turns to look at the 'judge': Dr. Jonathan Crane.

                          CRANE
           You are Philip Stryver, executive
           vice-president of Daggett
           Industries? (Off nod from Stryver.)
           The same Philip Stryver who for
           years lived like a prince off the
           blood and sweat of people less
           powerful?

                         

                          STRYVER
           Call Bane! I'm one of you!
          Jeers. Pull back to reveal a silent figure, watching. Bane.

                          CRANE
           Bane has no authority here. This is
           merely a sentencing hearing. The
           choice is yours, death or exile.
          Stryver looks around, terrified, as the crowd shouts
          'Death'.

                         

                          STRYVER

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

          Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the
          ice. A Blackgate Inmate undoes his handcuffs, whispering.

           Follow the tick ice. Try to swim -
           you're dead in minutes.

                          STRYVER
           Has anyone made it?
          The Blackgate Inmate turns away. Stryver is forced onto the
          ice. He shuffles forward, listening to the creaking...
          Stryver is a hundred yards out when the river swallows him.

                         

                         

          INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit
          around the room. Waiting. Gordon looks at his watch.

                         

                          GORDON
           Where the hell are they? It's not
           like we have a lot of time, here.

                          COP
           How long?

                          GORDON
           The bomb goes off tomorrow. We've
           got about eighteen hours to do
           something.

                         

                          COP
           To do what?

                          GORDON
           We mark that truck. Get a GPS on
           it, then we can start thinking
           about how to take it down.
          The door opens and Blake enters, followed by ten cops.
          Gordon is counting them in. He moves to Blake.

                         

                          GORDON

                          (LOW)
           That's it?
          Blake just looks at him. Gordon checks the faces. Realizes.

                         

                          GORDON
           Foley. Where's Foley, dammit?!
          Gordon heads for the door.

           130.

          EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

          Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.

           Jim. He's not here -

                         
          Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.

                          GORDON
           You're sending your wife to the
           door when the city's under
           occupation?!
          Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.

                          FOLEY
           Wait in the kitchen, honey.

                         

                          GORDON
           What did you do, bury your uniform
           in the backyard?

                          FOLEY
           Jim, you saw what they did to those
           Special Forces.

                          GORDON
           You forgotten all the years we went
           out on patrol with every gangbanger
           wanting to plant one as soon as our
           backs were turned?

                          FOLEY
           This is different and you know it.
           These guys run the city - the
           government's done a deal with them

                          -

                          GORDON
           Deal?! Bane's got their balls in a
           vice. That's not a deal -

                          FOLEY
           You move against Bane, the
           triggerman's gonna hit the button -

           131.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           You think he's given control of
           that bomb to one of 'the people'?!
           You think this is part of some
           revolution? There's one man with
           his finger on the button - Bane.

                          FOLEY
           We have to keep our heads down
           until they can fix this. If you
           still had family here maybe you'd -

                         

                          GORDON
           This only gets fixed from inside
           the city, Foley. (Calmer.) Look,
           I'm not asking you to walk down
           Grand in your dress blues. But
           we've got to do something before
           this maniac blows us all to hell.

                          FOLEY
           I'm sorry Jim. I gotta -

                         

                          GORDON
           Keep your head down? What's that
           gonna do tomorrow, when that thing
           blows?

                          FOLEY
           You don't know that's going to
           happen.
          Foley closes the door on Gordon. Gordon stands there.

                         

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           I hear you're looking for men,
           Commissioner.
          Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.

                         

                          MIRANDA
           How about me, instead?

                          GORDON
           Miss Tate, I can't ask you -

                         

                          MIRANDA
           My company built it.

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne built it.

           132.

                         

                         

                          MIRANDA
           And he wanted to destroy it. It was
           me who didn't listen. Please.
          Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.

                         

                          GORDON
           Let's go.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY


                         
          A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two
          Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.

                          GANGBANGER
           You steal from us, you little
           bastard?
          They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an
          apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is
          grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.
          Selina catches the apple.

                         

                          SELINA
           You boys know you can't come into
           my neighborhood without asking
           politely.

                         
          Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him
          stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,
          howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.

                          SELINA
           Never steal anything from someone
           you can't outrun, kid.

                          KID
           Now you're gonna take it.

                         
          Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.

                          SELINA
           Just tax.
          She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.

                         

           WAYNE (O.S.)
           Pretty generous, for a thief.
          Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,
          but weathered. Beard, work clothes.

           133.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           You came back. I thought they'd
           killed you.

                          WAYNE
           Not yet.

                          SELINA
           If you're expecting an apology -

                          WAYNE
           It wouldn't suit you. I need your
           help.

                          SELINA
           And why would I help you?

                         
          Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.

                          WAYNE
           For this. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          SELINA
           You're gonna trust me with that?
           After what I did to you?

                          WAYNE
           I admit I felt a little let down.
           But I still think there's more to
           you. In fact, I think for you -
           (indicates USB) this isn't a tool,
           it's an escape route. You want to
           disappear. Start fresh.

                         
          She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.

                          SELINA
           Start fresh? I can't even get off
           this island.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I can give you a way off. Once
           you've gotten me to Lucius Fox. I
           need you to find out where they're
           holding him. Then take me in.

                         

                          SELINA
           Why do you need Fox?

                          WAYNE
           To save this city.

           134.

                         

                         

                          SELINA
           Who says it needs saving? Maybe I
           like it this way.

                          WAYNE
           Maybe you do. But tomorrow that
           bomb's going off.

                          SELINA
           Get your powerful friend on the
           case.

                         

                          WAYNE
           I'm trying. But I need Fox.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY


                         
          Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking
          down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

                          GORDON
           Stay further up the block. (Points
           at Men.) They're gonna cross the
           street and try and slow the truck
           down. As it approaches, hit this
           button. If the needle hits two
           hundred - give me the signal and I
           mark the truck. Okay?

                         

                          BLAKE

                          (OVER RADIO)
           Heads up.

                         
          Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end
          of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men
          walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the
          road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the
          signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS
          locator at the lower part of the truck...

                         
          Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.

                          GORDON
           Got it.

                         
          They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an
          ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

                          MERCENARY
           Commissioner Gordon, you're under
           arrest.

           135.

                         

                          GORDON
           On whose authority?

                          MERCERNARY
           The people of Gotham.

                         
          Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and
          the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

                         

          INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY


                         
          Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come
          down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They
          kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to
          his aid.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 1
           Find this one a spot, he's got a
           big day tomorrow.
          They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.

                         

                          BASEMENT THUG 2
           We all do. It's not every day you
           bag Bruce Wayne...
          Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods
          at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda
          comes over.

                          MIRANDA
           Bruce?

                         

                          FOX
           You picked a hell of a time to go
           on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           How long until the core ignites?

                         

                          FOX
           That bomb goes off in twelve hours.

                          WAYNE
           Unless we can connect it to the
           reactor.

                          FOX
           If you can get it there. I'll find
           a way to plug it back in.
           (Indicates Miranda.) Can you get
           Miranda out?

           136.

                         

                         

                          WAYNE
           Not tonight. I'm sorry.

                          MIRANDA
           Do what's necessary.

                         

                          WAYNE

                          (TO FOX)
           Tonight I need you.

                          FOX
           What for?

                          WAYNE
           To get me back in the game.
          Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to spoil things, boys, but
           Bane wants these guys himself...
          The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks
          up.

                          WAYNE
           I won't forget about you.

                          MIRANDA
           I know.

                         

          EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

          The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman
          spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to
          the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.

                          FOX
           I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           He should be so lucky.
          And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

                         

                         

          INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

          Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.

                          WAYNE
           Any move I make against Bane or the
           bomb - the triggerman sets it off.

                          FOX
           They can't be using radio or cell -
           too much interference. Infrared
           doesn't have the range. It could
           only be micro-burst long wave...
          Wayne opens a panel in the wall, takes out equipment:
          mini-mines, Batarangs, utility belt...

                          WAYNE
           Could you block it?

                          FOX
           Yes. I need the EMP cannon-guidance
           mount from the Bat. You remember
           where you parked?
          Wayne nods. Smiles. The Batsuit rises from the floor...

                         

                         

          INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING (LATE DAY)

          Gordon and his men on trial. Crane presides.

                          CRANE
           The charges are espionage and
           attempted sabotage... Do you have
           anything to say in your defense?

                          GORDON
           No lawyer, no witnesses. What sort
           of due process is this?

                          CRANE
           More than you give Harvey's
           prisoners, Commissioner. Your guilt
           is determined, this is merely a
           sentencing hearing. What's it to
           be, death or exile?

                          GORDON
           Crane, if you think we are going
           willingly out onto that ice, you've
           got another think coming.

                          CRANE
           Death, then?

           138.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           Looks that way.

                          CRANE
           Very well... Death... (Smiles.) By
           exile.

                         
          He smashes his gavel. Bane leans in to one of his men,
          indicates Miranda.

                          BANE
           Bring her to me.

          Wayne bounds up the stairs. Fox follows, out of breath

                         

                          LUCIUS

          Fox emerges to see Wayne uncovering the Bat... As the sun
          sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.

                          FOX
           She fly pretty well?

                          WAYNE
           Even without the autopilot...

                          FOX
           Autopilot? That's what you're there
           for.

          Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.
          A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,
          then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...
          Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of
          liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.

           BATMAN (O.S.)
           Light it up.

           139.

                         

                         
          Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -
          jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the
          ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a

                          FOLEY'S KIDS
           Dad! Check it out!

                         

                          FOLEY'S WIFE
           Honey, take a look!
          Foley moves to a back window. Sees the flaming sign.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          A Mercenary nervously approaches Bane's back.

                          MERCENARY
           Sir?

                         
          Bane turns. The Mercenary points at the sign.

                          MERCENARY
           You think it's really him?

                         

                          BANE
           Impossible...

                         

          INT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER


                         
          Foley yanks up the floorboards. Pull his dress blues from
          their hiding place.

                         

          EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Mercenaries guarding the entrance see the sign. One of them
          moves out to get a better look. WHAM! He is taken out by a
          dark figure. The figure steps into the light - it is
          Blake...

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - CONTINUOUS

          Batman hands Gordon a metal box.

           140.

                         

                          BATMAN
           This blocks the remote detonator
           signal to the bomb. Get it onto the
           truck by sunrise. They might hit
           the button when it starts.

                         

                          GORDON
           When what starts?

                          BATMAN
           War.

                         

                         

          EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

          Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open
          manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb
          out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake
          is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,
          sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops
          onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman
          takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is
          finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.

                          BLAKE
           You missed a spot.
          Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.

                         

                          BATMAN
           If you're working alone, wear a
           mask.

                          BLAKE
           No one cares who I am.

                          BATMAN
           The mask is not for you. It's to
           protect the people you care about.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Huh. And you always seem to know
           where those people are. How is
           that?

                          BATMAN
           I lost someone once. Since then I
           break into their homes when they're
           sleeping and implant a tracking
           device on the back of their neck.

                         
          Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses
          Blake a mini-mine.

           141.

                         

                         

                          BATMAN
           On three - one, two, three -
          They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -
          the blasts barely move any rubble.

                         

                          BLAKE
           No offense, but you got anything
           bigger in that belt?

                          BATMAN
           That's to warn the men on the other
           side.
          Batman disappears into the shadows.

                          BLAKE
           But how do we -?
          KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.

                          BLAKE
           Okay.

                         
          Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but
          glad to be alive and carrying guns...

                          BLAKE
           What now?

                         

                          BATMAN
           All-out assault on Bane...but you
           need to get the people you care
           about across the bridge.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Why?

                          BATMAN
           In case we fail. Lead an exodus
           across the bridge. Save as many
           lives as you can.

                          BLAKE
           Don't you need me here?

                         

                          BATMAN
           You've given me an army. Now go.
          Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.

           142.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Thank you.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Don't thank me yet.

                          BLAKE
           I might not get a chance later.

                         
          Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at
          his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

                         

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,
          revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.

                          CATWOMAN
           Oh, you shouldn't have...
          She hops on, feeling the controls.

                         

                          BATMAN
           The mid-town tunnel's blocked by
           debris, but the cannons give you
           enough firepower to make a path for
           people.

                         
          Catwoman marvels at the controls...

                          BATMAN
           To start it, you -

                         

          VARROOOM!

                          CATWOMAN
           I got it.

                         

                          BATMAN
           We've got forty-five minutes to
           save this city -

                          CATWOMAN
           No, I've got forty-five minutes to
           get clear of the blast radius,
           because you don't stand a chance
           against these guys.

           143.

                         

                          BATMAN
           With your help I might.

                         
          She shakes her head.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'll open that tunnel, then I'm
           gone.

                         
          He looks at her.

                          BATMAN
           There's more to you than that.
          She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Sorry to keep letting you down.
          He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.
           Come with me. Save yourself. You
           don't owe these people anymore -
           you've given them everything...

                          BATMAN
           Not everything. Not yet.

                         
          Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the
          bike and takes off.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT


                         
          Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the
          tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN


                         
          The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the
          op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the
          building, forming up into an opposing line.
          A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.
          The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -
          until two Tumblers arrive.

                          VOICE

                          (OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

           DISPERSE. DISPERSE OR BE FIRED

           UPON.
          The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.

           144.

                         

                         

                          FOLEY
           There's only one police in this
           city.
          He steps forward. The line follows.

                         

                         

          EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.

                         

                          BANE
           Open fire.

                         

          EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into
          the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -
          WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and
          BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES
          and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until
          they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is
          filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

                         

          EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

          Catwoman, hearing the distant battle, blasts the tunnel
          blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon heard the fighting. Checks the box. Nervous.

                         

                          GORDON
           Come on, come on...

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Bane strides through the battle, taking out Cops left and
          right. A space clears - he is face the face with the
          Batman...

                         

                          BANE
           You came back. To die with your
           city.

                          BATMAN
           No. I came back to stop you.

           145.

                         

                         
          Bane leaps at Batman, smashing powerful blows into his head.
          Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.
          Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

          The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in
          a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck
          smashes into the bus and stops. Gordon and his men swarm in,
          blasting at the Guards. Gordon opens the back - empty. No
          bomb. Wrong truck.

                          GORDON
           That's impossible... Come on! Cut
           over to Fifth!

                         
          They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

                         

          INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Fox hurries into the reactor - starts throwing switches...

                         

          EXT. ST. SWITHIN'S HOME FOR BOYS - CONTINUOUS

          Blake leads the boys out of the home - points down the
          street.

                          BLAKE
           Knock on doors, spread the word -
           the bomb's going to blow! Get out
           by the South Street tunnel, or over
           the bridge! Do two blocks, then get
           back to the bus!
          The boys race down the street. Father Reilly climbs into the
          bus.

                         

                         

          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - CONTINUOUS

          Batman and Bane fight, Batman pushing Bane back - a Tumbler
          roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.

           146.

                         

                         

          INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.
          Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries
          guarding Miranda move towards them -

                         

                          BANE
           Stay back. He is mine -
          Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but
          Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the
          tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane
          bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a
          hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.

                          BATMAN
           Give me the trigger! You'd never
           give it to an ordinary citizen -
          Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through
          pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for
          relief.

                         

                          BANE
           I broke you. How have you come
           back?

                          BATMAN
           You thought you were the only one
           who could learn the strength to
           escape?
          Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.

                         

                          BANE
           I never escaped - R¯'s al Gh¯l

                          A U
           rescued me. That is why I must
           fulfill his plan. That is why I
           must avenge his murder.

                         

                          BATMAN

                          (CONFUSED)
           The child of R¯'s al Gh¯l made the

                          A U

                          CLIMB -

           MIRANDA (O.S)
           But he is not the child of R¯'s al

                          A
           Gh¯l...

          His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the

           He saw only a monster who could
           never be tamed. Whose very
           existence was a reminder of the
           hell he'd left his wife to die in.
           He excommunicated Bane from the

           was that he loved me. I could not
           truly forgive my father...

          a wave smashes into him, painfully...

           155.

                         

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to
          expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.

                          GORDON
           Give me a hand!
          The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try
          and grab the core but it is too hot.
           Let's get a cable on it and drag it
           out! Come on, we're almost there -
          Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.
          Dying.

                          TALIA
           Fox showed me how to operate the
           reactor core. Including the
           emergency flood -

          Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater -

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS


                         
          Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.

                          TALIA
           There is no way to stop this bomb.
           Prepare yourselves... (Looks up at
           Batman.) My father's work is done.

                         
          Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -
          Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to
          attach a hoist from the Bat.

                          GORDON
           What're you doing?

                          BATMAN
           Two minutes. I can fly it out over
           the bay...

                         
          Catwoman is at his side as he works.

                          CATWOMAN
           Rig it out to fly over the water,
           then bail -

           156.

                         

                         

                          BATMAN
           No autopilot.
          She takes this in. He stands to face her.

                          CATWOMAN
           You could've gone anywhere. Been
           anything. But you came back here.

                          BATMAN
           So did you.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           I guess we're both suckers.
          She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves
          to the Bat, Gordon alongside.

                         

                          GORDON
           So this is the part where you
           vanish, only this time you don't
           come back?

                         
          Batman opens the canopy.

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake grabs at the smallest boys, shoving them onto the bus.

                         

                          BLAKE
           Come on! On the bus!

                          FATHER REILLY
           What're you doing?

                         

                          BLAKE
           Protection from the blast -

                          FATHER REILLY
           It's an atom bomb -!

                         
          Blake turns on Father Reilly, furious.

                          BLAKE
           You think they need to hear that in
           their last seconds? You think I'm
           going to let them die without hope?

           157.

                         

                         

          EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

          Gordon puts a hand on Batman's arm.

                          GORDON
           I never cared who you were -

                         

                          BATMAN
           And you were right.

                          GORDON
           But shouldn't the people know the
           hero who saved them?

                          BATMAN
           A hero can be anyone. That was
           always the point.

                         
          Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.
           Anyone. A man doing something as
           simple and reassuring as putting a
           coat around a little boy's
           shoulders to let him know that the
           world hadn't ended...
          The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers

                         -
          INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat
          around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,
          loving.
          Gordon looks up to the cockpit -

                          GORDON
           Bruce Wayne?
          - but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS
          out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the
          tunnel mouth.

                         
          The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A
          building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but
          there's no power to get over it.

                         

                         

          EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

          Blake shouts into the bus -

                          BLAKE
           Heads down! Heads down, now!

           158.

                         

                         

                          FATHER REILLY
           Blake, they need to make their
           peace.
          Blake turns to him, furious.

                         

                          BLAKE
           They're children! They have no
           peace to make -
          An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,
          startled, turns to the children on the bus.
           Get down! This is it!
          The smallest of the boys stares through the window past
          Blake.

                         

                          LITTLE BOY
           No. That's Batman!
          Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of
          Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves
          dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth
          of the river...the bay...the ocean...
          Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST
          - wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly
          over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

                         
          As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its
          inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and
          boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see a beautiful city and a
           brilliant people rising from this
           abyss...'
          Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.

                         

           GORDON (V.O.)
           'I see the lives for which I lay
           down my life, peaceful, useful,
           prosperous and happy...'

                         

                         

          EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

          Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is
          Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is
          there, whose face we do not yet see...

           159.

                         

                         

                          GORDON
           'I see that I hold a sanctuary in
           their hearts, and in the hearts of
           their descendants, generations
           hence. It is a far, far better
           thing that I do, than I have ever
           done...'
          Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.
           'It is a far, far better rest that
           I go to than I have ever known.'

                         
          Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...
          Alfred. Tears streaming.
          Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.
          Gordon and Blake follow. Alfred, alone with the Wayne
          family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of
          Thomas and Martha Wayne.

                          ALFRED
           I'm so sorry. I failed you. You
           trusted me, and I failed you.
          And the old man's shoulders begin to shake with sobs.

                          GORDON
           Can I change your mind about
           quitting the force?

                         

                          BLAKE
           No. What you said about structures.
           About shackles. I can't take it.
           The injustice. (Gestures at
           gardens.) I mean...no one's ever
           going to know who saved an entire
           city.

                          GORDON
           They know. (Off look.) It was
           Batman.

          granite. We move in on the stone face...

                         

           VOICE (V.O.)
           Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to

          The voice belongs to Wayne's lawyer, addressing a small

          Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.

                          BLAKE
           Try my legal name.

                         
          The Clerk glances at the license. Checks.

                          CLERK
           Yup, here it is.

                         
          She reaches down behind the desk, sorting through various
          items, and hands him a sports bag. Blake takes it, curious.

                          CLERK
           You should use your full name. I
           like that name... Robin.

           Any word on the missing item?

                          CLERK
           No, not yet.

           Well, they'd better leave no stone

           But Mr. Fox, it's already been

          Blake sits in his car looking at a GPS device, puzzled.
          Beside him, the sports bag, open. In it is a piece of paper

          Blake gets out of the car with the bag. Follows the GPS into

          gear...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon steps onto the roof with his pile of arrest
          reports...

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          As Alfred sips his drink, he glances up at a couple at the
          next table. Strangers. Alfred looks back down...

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          Moving in on the waterfall from inside... Blake bursts
          through, landing painfully on the shale inside. he gets to
          his feet, moving cautiously into the cave...

                         

                         

          EXT. MCU - NIGHT

          Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening
          them. He stops. Sees something. The searchlight...fixed.
          Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat
          symbol... He looks up into the night...

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY


                         
          Blake lights his torch...then ducks, crouching, as THOUSANDS
          of SCREECHING creatures descend. BATS...

           164.

                         

                         

          EXT. CAFÉ, FLORENCE - DAY

          Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,
          seeing...across the tables, a familiar couple... Bruce
          smiles at Alfred, who nods. Bruce turns back to the pretty
          brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.

                         

                         

          INT. CAVE - DAY

          Blake lifts his head, FEELING the bats all around him...
          Blake RISES, and is SWALLOWED by the darkness of their wings
          and we -

          FADE OUT.

          CREDITS.

                         

          THE END.
